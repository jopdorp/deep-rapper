Song:   One Choice, One Life
Typed by: no1wammy@hotmail.com

[Down]
What is death?
Death is the views of our religions
Philosophies
Political ideologies
The greater unknown
The ultimate truth
A game of chess
One false move
Could be your last breath
So be careful, lil' homie
The time is now
One choice
One life
There's no coming back

Chorus: Ese Daz
Your time
Is now, get ready
Will you
Go do, slowly
One choice, one life, it's deadly
Mi mente crimena, la muerte va llegar

[Verse 1: Ese Daz]
I'm criminal minded
You been blinded
Looking for your dumb homeboy, you can't find it
You lost it
So when death comes, will you die slow?
Here comes the black crow
Relax, just let it go
I know you thinking of the dirt
You did in the past
Just like a movie, you see scenes of your life in a flash
Under the street, now
Getting faded with the homies
Living that lifestyle, sharing all the war stories
From eastside to westside, in this life
Another soldier dies on the front line
No second chances, like a game of chess
One false move, it could be your last breath
You can cheat me
But you can't cheat death
Try to quarterback sneak, man, put that shit to rest
When it's your time, you can't outrun the beast
Just take a deep breath and rest in peace

Hook: Ese Daz
Ven aqui
Ave Maria, lo que tengo aqui
Llego la ahora de morir
Vas a llorad a vida
La, la-la-la, la, la, la, la

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 2: Down]
Now let me break it down, just to tell a little story
Fresh out of the caja by my dead little homie
Little savage homeboy, trying to make a name
At the age of twelve
He joined the neighborhood gang
On his thirteenth birthday, he did juvenile hall
You can tell he had a G ever since the start
His older brothers and uncles
They all gangbang
So I guess it's a tradition, it's a family thang
Only fifteen and a freshman in high school
That's when he hit the paper and all over the news
Little homie on the calle and he's all laid out
Five shots to the dome, right in front of the south
A little homie lo matando a los quince anos
Se murio por el repe for the love of barrio
My tears fall off when I tell my story
How I miss my homie

Repeat Hook

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 3: Ese Daz]
Another gun cocked
You hear the gunshots
Another body drops
A mother's heart stops
Another casket closed, carried by six
Another family mourns, how it'd come to this
If I could have, one wish, I'd bring 'em all back
They say the good die young, so I guess I'm young and bad, hun
I'm real careful with my life
Like a surgeon makes incesions when he uses a knife
We live blind
Cause sometimes we can't see
So infatuated with death, it becomes reality
Like my homie Jose
Would always say
"I'm a die real soon, going out the G way"
The next week
He passed away
Like Doughboy in Boyz N The Hood, I saw him fade away
When it's your time, you can't outrun the beast
Just take a deep breath and rest in peace

Repeat Hook

Intro: 
1-2 1-2 D.L. Versatile E check it out.

Hook:
I got 20 bars to bust so now I demonstrate
One times 20 and one times 8
One times 20 and one times 8 I got 20 bars to bust it
So now I demonstrate

Funky D.L.:
A-yo Kay Sera Sera, what will be will be
I organize the phat track my name be Funky D
L definatly you know I get the loop on
Take off my 20 percent like a Corn Flake coupon
I troop on fools trying to get me down 
Me and my DJ make the crew who produce the sound
You wanna represent boy you should of came up sooner
Cause now we transmit like a FM tuner
At all frequencies so people get with it
Or your face will feel like Mike Tyson just hit it
Cause I got the flows so kid whats worse
Trying to battle D.L., DJ Sticks or Versatile E?
Yeah now you know the deal
Bad boy MC showing how I feel
On the microphone so I suggest you take heed
Cause I be blowing up like that movie Speed
Yeah you know the style you know the idea
And this is my chance to expand my career
So I'm gonna take it and just keep rappin'
Cause in a year or two who will know what will happen

Hook

Versatile E:
Make Room it's the individual number 2
My rap got you choking and you still don't have a clue (what) Here's my 20
bars on my 20 and 8
I'm a wipe 'em out quickly like food on my plate
Don't debate coming and close the gate
Don't like my style being smuggled to another state
Beyond your 2000 skills I'm early you ain't late
What you find hard I find just a piece of cake
Deliberly bad like uh, hepititis
Well I'm bustin' rhymes you facin' lyrical crisis
Ain't the nicest but I flow like D-Nice
With an unusual flavor add some Versatile spice
At night look at the sky the smallest star is me
I ain't there no more it's my shine that you can see
With light speed on my way to uh the star maps
At the same time have a break let my brain relax
Competition ain't even that strong anymore
I got many worlds to study, learn and explore
My plan is to go where no man has gone before
Cuz even Indian heads ain't ready for the (crashing) I got in store

Hook:
I got 8 bars to bust it so now I demonstrate
One 16 that's made by two 8's
One 16 that's made by two 8's 
I got 8 bars to bust it so now I demonstrate (x2)

Funky D.L.:
A-yo I represent hip hop and for that I'm proud
And just like Rakim I can Move The Crowd
So what you gonna do when you see me approach
See you gonna be the rookie but I be the coach
Yo that's right D.L. is the name
A-yo that's right I can never be the same
But there's one thing you must understand
See I'm gonna represent and do the best I can

Hey a-yo I saw a doctor about my swift hermaphosis
And totally rapping ill was my diagnosis
Ask the doctor "Yo tell me what's gonna happen?"
We done to seize enemies world is the prognosis
Oh well I could of guessed but what I hear that was bucks
But only would hear the first round bell
20-20-8-8 a glass of prune only the making
A move that's true cause you know we're never faking

Hook:
I had 20 bars to bust it then I had an 8
I grab hold the mic so I could demonstrate
First I had a 20 then I had an 8
The name of this here is 20-20-8-8 (x2)

Song:   Three Emcees
Typed by: Nelson2014@aol.com

Xzibit intro:
Yes yes. Ahh ahh. Bring it live
Yo it's the X to the Z from the Likwit Squad

Hook:
"One MC" "After" (x3)
"On the mic"- Souls Of Mischief

[Xzibit]
All that get money take money sound funny
So I stick to my own I can feel it in my bones
These clones and clowns ain't really down
Play the background westbound
Huntin' down pussy like a bloodhound
Plus I feel that no style is darker than mine
You can stick that into places where the sun don't shine
All you one hit wonders only in it for the spotlight
Spend half a million dollars still don't sound tight
Bring truth to the light
I write rhymes for the under
Blunt smokin' bottle crackin' all day slumber
Who wouldn't give a fuck if the world fell down
As long as I can twist a fat one and pass it around
Mr. X to the Z from the Likwit Crew
LA to Elviaire with my man EQ
Coming live and direct with your neck like this
Come home and smoke a spliff in the Benz with Swift
I stay fucked up

Hook

[Del]
Lyrically ingenious my flows are intravenous
Kids are squeamish 
When they attempt to refless 
I'm the Apex 
Shows get rocked half the words ?
Hold your glock your whole goal is props
You'll never get 'em
My rhythm just fluctuates 
You can't O.D. no matter how much you take
I rush your plates 
Crack your lenses clean like Benzene 
Cool like Menthol 
My shits the end all
Majorly gain your speed slow your role 
You lie and like Pinochio your nose will grow
Let's go
Underground compress co
Bust these jewels these diamonds out 
But still some of these niggas don't know what we rhymin' bout
Mine in doubt 
Traversing' the Earth like zombies 
And rocks your dirty laundry
Presented to the world as comedy
Del rips it honestly that's why the girls are found of me
And don't be squandering your little flow
You ain't got many 
You're fly spinning
We constitution 
You seek contribution from Del for usage 
Over these acoustics
I take time out for use of 
Harkus representing proof in you walkman
Lockin' competition out of studios
Everyday I live is like a musical 
Create my own score 
More funkier than Shaft on my musical path

Hook

[Casual]
They like "ooh. Don't say that."
When it's lay doe A dat Competition where they at?
I diss 'em
Steady at the rhythm 
Like a pilot I keep you silent
Through the turbulence words will get violent
Mega doses exposes is flagellant composes
All you get is roses on your grave you misbehave 
It's the brave courageous lyrically contagious
Spiritually engage with the psychedelic waves of
An Egyptian
We rips then
Cover the mic like the sun we eclipsin'
Cause no light shine through a flow like mine
Casual might ignite the mic for pastime
With one style older than the sundial
My elaborate connection of words is fun how
I display, dismay this way gettin' bissy
Crackers show off the top while I'm hittin' a J
My immaculate style attackin' with nouns and verbs 
for the wack it gets foul
Got a Full Metal Jacket off rhymes to press 
To manifest under pressure 
Past style a lyrical treasure
Never the less I get fresher
It's involital my biological make up composes of flesh and blows
Will dispose of all 
When they appear in my crystal ball 
I know you wish I fall
"Yes y'all"

(R) (West side)

[Verse One: Sauce Money]
I spit solely for the guacemole
Come through and make a rapper do a back flip rock a rolly and
Reach for my glock slowly if you try to interfere on how I stack chips
I take chicks to the tele just a happy fan
Now she wanna get a glimpse of my magic hand
She said she like the way it stretch out like plastic man
Sauce money tell me where would you have it land
Told shorty look I got to get back to my grands
Hurry up I am in the rush like jackie chan
Married woman, single or engaged, hood rats still got them to creep
Now we rock them to sleep
Because we got the best songs that pesese charm
Besides if you tricky you just chance head strong
Rappers better respect dawns and ex-cons
and keep your vest on this is how we speak with teflon

[Verse Two: Sheek Louch]
Aiyyo it's Sheek Louch nigga and I will pop till y'all gone
Only thing I knew niggaz popped and it's gone
And y'all might pop shit but that's about it
What you know about guns that come out my sleeve
And bullets that fly around your head like bee's
That will hit you and leave holes the size of pee's jes
When I flow it's like tae-kwon-doe
On some do-jo and it just a hobby
How fuck Daniel-san going to beat Mr. Miyagi
Wax on wax off with a knock out or better
I leave three threw the e of your enyce sweater
What pop shit and I am first day delivery
Straight threw your chest pope on your block
In a big brown truck like I am ups
And I don't know about y'all that re-up real small
You don't spend more then a thousand at the mall
If you owe sheek pay me I don't care how you hit me
It don't race me if your car don't cost more then fifty
I'm that cat that threatens on y'all mc's
With a devil flow that will pop your rosary beeds
I from where bitches that know about cooking up coke
Bring ever gram back and keep heat by the twat
That will blend in perfect in a deminacan spot
Now it's me that nigga that shine like glitter
And I must say dogg I am a hell of a spitter
We finish things y'all hell of a quiters

[Verse Three: Ras Kass]
I spit from the genitals bitch, leave 'em masculine skinch
Got niggaz panackin, petro and penanican flinch
Grew a mechanical inch the root of all evil
Green theft and green spray with a tech but we can't all eat thow
Cause y'all fethal, we run lethal, homicide victims of a fed fax and pete gold
Sugar nobody is ever equal [why] cause the more we make
the more we taking from other people
Livin in puerto rico padarin LAX to JFK
At baggage claim with three hoes like Santa's day
My third eye be the equivilant to the album red pie
so I give you a piece of my mind, just multiply times infinite
Spiritual elevate so I high commite drive bye's while I sky dive
Sip on my time perform shit only concieved in sci-fi so why try test
It's boom bye bye Mr. Ice real guy
You must have been looking some where else like biggie smalls lazy eye
Pop sicker then your average Acquired Immune Deficiency Symdrome infected fast

[Chorus: Sheek Louch]
We don't care where your from nigga east or west
And we don't care what you wear we don't aim for the vest
It's lox, sauce and Ras Kass three of the best
Only niggaz with money we don't fuck with the rest
We don't care where your from nigga east or west
And we don't care what you wear we don't aim for the vest
It's lox, sauce and Ras Kass three of the best
Only niggaz with money we don't fuck with the rest ya heard

[Magic]
Dear heavenly father.
What about niggas like me?
Do we make it to the golden gates?
Cause I don't wanna be stuck in this motherfucker.
[C-Murder]
Hm. 
I always wondered is there a place
for the bad guys to go after they checked out.
This lifetime nigga.
Is there a heaven for a thug?
Check it.

[C-Murder/Magic]
Mama, please show a nigga love  x4

[Magic]
I used to question what am I here for
Back in the days the game nigga I'd die for
Livin my life for petty nickles I'm hustlin, born to be seen thuggin
Young nigga so pussy for Magic was never trouble
Knuckleheads, just messin up my plans for the future
But see habit is hard to change and I'm doin just what I'm used to
Satisfied cause all these worldly things impress me
The sounds of havin a presidential really upsets me
Devotin all my time to livin the wrong way
Smokin on multiple blunts and sippin on alazay
My friends convicted felons
Birds of a same feather flock together
That's what my grandma used to tell us
Peer pressure, little nigga, livin life like a thug
Just understand that these the only niggas show me love
I see the picture but it's not clear
If there's a heaven for a thug then why am I still here
My lord

[C-Murder]

Up above
Mama please show a nigga love x4

[Mac]
I was a long way from heaven or so they told me
In the eyes of the reverend I was unholy
Seen death around the corner by my partner and them house
At first hand I was tought close your motherfuckin mouth
Little one, I was young but I wasn't stupid
I heard what he said, don't nobody gotta loop it
It was the liquor in me at twelve that made this nigga rebel
I was tryin to be grown, plus keep up with them Jones (what)
But life slapped me in them yappers
And it said nigga you seen alot you need to be a rapper
And I was told ain't no rest for the wicked
I guess I can't sleep cause I fuck hoes and kick it
But that's some other shit, I beg the man to forgive me, I'm only a youth
Still runnin from the troops in these Timbaland boots
Went from hand me down's to versace suits
Infatuated by this rap game, jeeps and coots
Woah

[C-Murder]
Is there a heaven for a thug
Up above
Mama please show a nigga love x4

[Magic]
I hear a knock at my door, who is it
I hope it aint judgement day cause if it is then I'm finished
If thugs don't go to heaven then I know that I'm up shit creek
Forgive me Lord but I was only tryin to stay on my feet
I gotta question, why is life so goddamn hard
So many laws, so many flaws, I'm just askin you Lord
Every soul I took deserved it
I never killed a man over petty bullshit
You fuck with me or my fam and I'll be damned if I don't put him to rest
So will I burn eternally just cause I failed your test
When the Lord is my shepard and I shall not walk
I'm runnin hard toward the light tryin to get out the dark
I'm tryin to change cause I know you got a spot for me
I need AC and hell's just too hot for me
So put my name on my wings written in blood
And when I come section me off with the rest of my thugs

Why not live with the drive to inspire?
My ambition is flawless
This is gorgeous as this Porsche is but this is about this Benz, ya dig?
Pass me a lighter, Rozay.. I need a J {M-M-Maybach Music}
I appreciate, the opportunity
Somethin' special, my nigga...

[Chorus: Rick Ross] + (Wale)
600 Benz, house six hundred grand
That was six years ago, whips come from Japan
I get that work on my face...
I get that work on my face... ay
(Boy, 600 Benz, condo six hundred grand)
(I got twelve hundred kicks, them bitches straight from Japan)
(My ambition is wicked I put that shit on my hand)
I get that work on my face (I put that shit on my man, boy)

[Wale]
Wale, real nigga, where the totem, blowin' bomb haze
I just tell CJ keep on rollin' that's my shortyg
Tinted out, you ain't seeing through
All black everything, this shit like a HBCU
Maybach music, major moves, bitch I'm saving major loot
I make my old bitches buy me all the latest shoes
One whip just ain't enough, I just seen 33
You only half a W without a second V
Gotta be dreamin, bitch I gotta be chosen
Shawty when I was 20 I had a Camry and tokens
But now I'm ok, bitch I got my shit together
Rozay told me keep on working, shawty you'll be rich forever, ever
Forever my endeavours 
And I sever my opponents, bitch I'm cold like its in Denver
The dilemma is, you think I got no conscience
You think I just here flossin' and talkin' 'bout car shit

[Chorus]

[Jadakiss]
AH-HAH... AH-HAH, yup
Dependin' on how I feel, either the coupe or sedan (uh-huh)
I'm only dealin' with you, nothin' to do with your man (nah)
Niggas ruin your plans, it's best to do what you can (yep)
I'm up to six hundred bricks, started with two hundred grams (whoo)
Hand to hand in the cold, pockets on hella swole
I was breakin' ‘em down (uh-huh), now I'm sellin' ‘em whole (yeah)
Work straight out the kitchen, ain't no competition (nah)
You just shut up and listen and you can complete the mission
Know you want me to fall (uh-huh), I don't do nothing but ball
You heard I was in jail, well I just came from the mall (rumors)
I'm on my way to the jeweler bout to cop me a Muller (uh)
Keep the digital ruler at arm's length of the Ruger (yeah)
Life's a bitch and I feel her, ain't nobody iller (nobody)
Perico Godzilla, catch me blowing vanillas (haha)
Used to be blood money now it's go hard scrilla
After I count it all up, I'ma go to the dealer and get a..

[Chorus]

[Wale]
SKRRT, hope you heard that intro
This that I been grindin' cause I've been savin' for that Benz flow
To mash on assholes with petty badges
Tell em' niggas we throwed, but they never gon catch us
If I am pulled over, I know they gon be on it
Cause it's hot in here and I got no L like the '72 Dolphins
Woooh, race my niggas
And I bet you never pass me like a free safety, nigga
I'm Polamalu, 600 the newest model
My newest motto to use a condom with newest models
Uhh, got a hundred on the dash, young
Ya ain't killers ya'll got hundred yard dash guns
I'm a rare one, camo's and some rare ones
Where I'm from is a circus hope you don't expect a fair one
Dropping hundreds like it ain't nothin'
Really it was but you know I never sayin' nothin'

Are we not the strongest? Huh?
I say we move with power and strike now!

[Intro: U-God]
Yo, it's like this, yo

[U-God]
When I'm locked down I use Timbs as my shower slippers
I'm in the background, mingling with the powder flippers
In the basement, hard body, power lifters
I crush shower in the sifters, see how I lift her?
Universal God, I stay scientific
The Kid with the Golden Arms, Iron Fister
Stay Asiatic, so cinematic
Noise in the attic, bang out with them automatics
It's hood politics, that bring the hunger back
I'm straight chopping wood, call me the lumberjack
Check the catalog, put out a hundred packs
Watch for drug sniffing dogs, they coming from the back
I'm straight thunder clap, the funky drummer's back
It's pure Dopium, give 'em a heart attack
I stay stacking plaques, like ancient artifacts
Joe Namath in the game, I'm the quarterback

[Ghostface Killah]
Yo, eight balls of coke, blunt to the greenery
Pounds in the trunk, get you a concrete scenery
Hand made ox'll get you duffed in the mess hall
Snitch niggas run to C.O.'s to confess all
This is street knowledge, now that I school college
Like a speech from The GZA, sharp like The RZA
Go run with a scissor, nigga, the true fizzer
Truth number, drop a few jewels in the booth
Used to boost cracks, stuff 'em inside of a tennis ball
And throw 'em when they rushing the block, trust no cops
Driving around with two mitts in my socks
Cooked coke'll get you more trouble then money
Don't crawl with the dust juice, the pigs is hungry
You think they ain't watching, they watching, while you uptown copping
Back home, while you cooking and chopping
They scheming on the block, waiting to get it popping

[GZA]
He had a sword and an ax that cuts
Under a robe that was woven from silver and gold and waxed it up
His army was so great, the quantity
His crops and life stock, boost the economy
Many will travel by boat to see him
His image adorn most schools and coliseums
A merchant hustle those silk and velvets
Portrait illuminated when the torch was well light
Picture so beautiful painted, that
One thought agree to move, cuz it will leave a mood
Or energy, you see his wife practice yoga
Made herbal enhancers that have saved the soldiers
God with treasures, in the chambers, halls and votes
Well prepared for all assaults, heavy guarded village
Armed with the sharpest weapons, designed to pierce
And cause blood spillage

[Masta Killa]
From a young teen, my murder team inspired by crimes
See Allah Just' granted permission, for my position
So now I write rhymes escaping this repetitive cycle
Swinging dimes, losing time, doing hard time
Teaching ya'll mathematically, come see
The epitome of what you wanna be, M.C.
My semi auto gun, mandatory at the sound clash
The mic touch, dance mouth shut, pounds of the best
Green, glass bottles of Don, I sip the liquor slow
Flow so devastating when I go solo
Even when I'm dolo, pretty gun I'm holding
Head swollen off the solid gold soul
Iron Mic Pole beat your face like you stole something, trust me
Livin' life royalty, all wise and healthy
Welcome to the best of me, from knowledge to infinity
Never stopping my trajectory, I'm galactic

[Cappadonna]
Yo, peace to all of the Gods and all of the earths
We've been building like this ever since the first day of birth
The more I start to build, the better I feel
Keep ignorant niggas from me, use dummies for shield
You not God body, son, you just garbage and real snotty
Cherry head gaylords still stuck in the lobby
This the first now born, son, I'm blessed with mad lessons
Conquer crazy devils, my mind is a weapon
You can't fast with me, and avoid the swine
You degenerate MC, I'm the best of mankind
Allah U Akbar, straight jews and real stars
I'm down with The RZA, got help for the widow son
Pop off on you, you ain't nothing to me dunn-dunn
Original Taizeen, holy water, the Visine
Designated wordplay, God respect my dean
Shine on little stars and respect the queen

[Inspectah Deck]
New York Giant, call me Deck Umenyiora
Fresh with the water connect, two and a quarter
Deal with the dealer, don't trust the transporter
My job is done, once I get into the border
Pedico, coke game is kilos of cocaine
Hypodermic needle to the groove, I dose veins
Overdose ya, you know the product is raw, right?
Lines take you there like I wrote it with off white
Got 'em bent up, hands looking like a tin cup
Sorry, no consignment, get your ends up
Move from the gate now, he on his way straight to Jake, now
I'm on the hush, but my weight loud
Got the shakes now, how they want it, bad
Five or six heads, chippin' in for a bag
I got the works like a burger deluxe
Get you fixed while I'm serving it up, word to us

Kick that shit...

I don't drink brass monkey
Like to be funky
Nickname Bullet Loc
Your 8-ball junkie
Bass drum kickin' to show my shit
Rockin', holdin' my dick
Boy
I don't quit
Crowd rockin' muthafucka from around the way
I got a six-shooter, yo, mean I'm brave
Rollin' through the hood
To find the boys
Kick dust and cuss, crank up some noise
Police on my drawers
I have to pause
40 Ounce's in my lap and it's freezin' my balls
Hook a right turn, let the boys go past
Then I say to myself: "They can kiss my ass!"
Hip to get drunk got the 8 in my lips
Put in the old tape Marvin Gaye's greatest hits
Turn the shit up had the bass on high on
Cruisin' through the East Side, South ??
Seen the bitch ass
Then I say word
Took a look at the face and the bitch was street curb
Ho's on my dick for the title I'm holdin'
Bullet Loc fucked up and got the 8-ball rollin

In the cityyyyy --> Ronnie Hudson's West Coast Pop Lock
Kick that shit  --> Flavor Flav

Ridin' on ??? weed is on ???
Turned down the sound
And ditch the law
Stopped at a light and had a fit
Cause old bitch almost wrecked my shit
Flipped his ass off, put it to the floor
Bottle was empty so I went to the store
Nigga on tilt cause I was drunk
See an enemy on mine, had to go in my trunk
Reached inside cause it's like that
Came back out with a silver gat
Fired at the punk and it was all ?? cause
I had to show the nigga what time it was
Pulled out the heat
And like a mirage
A busta like that got out of dodge
Sucker's on me cause the title I'm holdin'
Bullet Loc's fucked up and got the 8 ball rollin'

In the cityyyyy --> Ronnie Hudson's West Coast Pop Lock
Kick that shit  --> Flavor Flav

Olde English 800 cause that's my brand
Take it in a bottle, 40, quart or can
Drink it like a madman, yes I do
Fuck the police and the 5.0 too
Stepped in the party, I was drunk as hell
3 bitches already said: "Ohh Bullet your breath smells!"
40 ounce in hand
That's what I got
(Yo, you see Bullet earlin' in the parkin lot?)
Stepped on your foot, cold dissed your ho'
Asked her to dance and she said: "Hell no!"
Called her a bitch cause that's the rule
(Bitch, who d'you callin' a bitch?)
Boyz in the hood tryin' to keep me cool
Tell your homeboy you wanna kick my butt
I walked in your face and we get 'em up
I start droppin' the dogs
And watch you fold
Just dumb full of cum, got knocked out cold
(Ah aha, made you look sick you snotty nosed prick
 Now your fly bitch is all over his dick)
Punk got dropped cause the title I'm holdin'
Bullet Loc fucked up and got the 8-ball rollin'

In the cityyyyy --> Ronnie Hudson's West Coast Pop Lock
Kick that shit  --> Flavor Flav 

Pass the brew muthafucka while I tear shit up
And y'all listen up close to roll call
Bullet Loc's in this bitch, I got money and juice
Blue crooks with me and we make the deuce
Ant Banks makes the beats so muthafuckin' funky
Do the Olde 8
Fuck the brass monkey
I write all the rhymes
That I say
Hail to the niggas from C.I.A.
Blue Tray is down and in effect
We make hardcore jams so fuck respect
Make a toast blue beast to the title I'm holdin'
Bullet Loc's fucked up and got the 8-ball rollin'

In the cityyyyy --> Ronnie Hudson's West Coast Pop Lock

Yeah yeah nigga
Bullet Loc is in this biotch
Rest In Peace to my nigga Eazy-E
Wha-wha-wha-wha-wha what!

Typed by: rapforum@hotmail.com

Chorus: 2X (first time a capella)
Somebody scream bloody murder, inside of my head
The exuctioner's plot controlled by the feds
Take illegal action, they want Mumia dead
This nation of savages been trying to kill us for years

[Tragedy Khadafi]
Yo, federal indictment, militant mind enlightment
Son, we outburst, in the court room, full of excitement
Face the jury, thugged out, with blind fury
They want us all under the jam, end of the story
Brave and heartless, we can have a million marches
But when you black you under attack, son regardless
Live by the gun, dunn, and die by the gun
And revolutionize minds until freedom's won

[Black Thought]
Check it out, they want us knocked locked down boxed up in the ground
It's war time now from how the sufferin sound
We deep in the realm, the planet petrified overwhelmed
We all stars livin life out on surveilance film
New World law enforced, mind rape, cerebral holocaust
No escape, fire for burn the execution date shatter
We on the front lines prepared
I want Mumia out the cage the time for action is here

[Pharaohe Monch]
When you take the attempted assassination of Mumia Jamal they set em up
I come to find out, Tupac they wet 'im up
Pharaohe, standin behind my fucking curtains
with a double-barrle rehearsin
Ready for war now for certain
Uh, biological warfare suits
Black gas masks, black boots, half-assed niggas become troops
My tons of global warriors is booty now
Plenty thug niggas is fruity now

Chorus: 2X

[Chuck D]
As you peep the illusion cuz I see my peoples losin
The overall battle to keep republicrats from choosin
Afterall, I feel the bruisin of the constitution
When my back's against the wall, manifestin in their destiny
Shit they just testin me, Mumia's spirit blessin me
No alibi, I know Allah is not their alli
I believe I can fly, but their type of freedom is a lie
So fuck the government, C.I.A. and F.B.I.

[Last Emperor]
Shatan will destroy anything for the right price
In a physical world one man cannot die twice
To the spiritual world your soul cannot fly twice
Yet could this be the second time they crucify Christ?
Ask Ed Asner, the actor, after they execute him
There will be a peasant uprising like the French Revolution
In conclusion, if you detect evil
Free the voice of the voiceless, defender of oppressed people

[Dead Prez]
I say, "fuck the police," cause they been killin us for years
This ain't no free country, niggas get murdered for their ideas
Free Mumia means all Africans let go
Cause just livin in the ghetto puts you on death row
You don't know? You seen how the tried to do Assata
Till some real niggas organized theyselves and went and got'er
Lotta crackers verbalize if Mumia dies, fire in the skies
But only time'll tell the truth from the lies

        "What he said was so clear, so true, that I had to stop everything,
         and concentrate on his lessons."

[Afu-Ra]
We need masters in biology, zoology
to overtake, illuminati, trick-knowledgy
Transform, reciprocate your mental state
Now make a date, to overtake your objective
Show that through life, that everything is connected
But not in categories, 'cause that's the devil's warning
Symbols, of cannibalism, ruin your vision
Then thought formulate in your mind, with no precision

[Goldii Lokks]
We paid a crude price, for what they call life
Dubbed without grief, took him out that night
Some'll ask why, ma say they hate the look in his eyes
Like the child, little omen, they want him crucified
The last on the battlefield, the last alive
Beside, they don't want the African to survive
Sable, the son of Satan was involved in the plot
Legalize the homicide, his soul gon' rot

[Pharoahe Monch]
Yo, they attempted assassination of Mumia Jamal, they set'im up
I come to find out, Tupac they wet'im up
Pharaohe, standin behind my fuckin curtains
with a double-barrel, rehearsin
Ready for war now for certain
Uh, biological warfare suits
Black gas masks, black boots, half-assed niggas become troops
My dunns are doper warriors, so prove thee now
Plenty thug niggas are fruity now

[Aceyalone - Freestyle Fellowship]
Freedom is that cold road seldom travelled, by the multitude
We need to depict to describe it, so that we can cultivate this food
Movivate a few of you fools, regenerate the mood
Free ourselves from mental bondage, free ourselves from Family Fueds
Now follow me through this prophecy, building our colonies
Where our pillars and columns be, bigger than the coliseum
I call 'em like I see 'em, the devil does a devil's dance
They wanna murder Mumia, take action, its the only chance

[Wise Intelligence - Poor Righteous Teachers]
They tellin' me, son, grab a gun or two, money don't come to you
Stop rhymin 'bout what white people done to you
Look, burn a blunt or two, screw who you wanna screw
Do what you wanna do and lesson went to you
Kill all that teacher shit, its too much teased to get
And if Jesus exists, just don't believe in it
Eat the bread of wickedness, join the global Satanists
Give death row sentences to black revolutionists

[Slimkid Tre]
Now they will flee and guard, just to feel the power
Not to justify, that of you and I
Holdin daggers up and lettin you decide
After passin information thats falsified
Stand behind a lie, what does it cost to die?
What does it cost to live? Why do they specify?
These terms of why, when they ain't the most high
They fear they will kill, but the soul will never die

[Sayeed]
Through seasons, legions and demons, pleadin heathens and even Stevens
I've wandered through regions, cease freezin, even some breathin
Some leave in pieces, will freeze caps, like Clevelands
Now she seemin like semen, slide you home like the decon
Use my mental for potential through Mumia's mind
Behind these bars, diamond scarred for the chorus
I climb all fifty steams and lock cats in Mars like dogs
Fog will clear like tears after resolution
This daily fight through revolution

[Zack de la Rocha]
You see the capital thugs got nervous
'cause he refused to be their servant
'Cause he spit truth that shook heads and burn like black churches
Prose and verses, filled with a million black hearses
Watch, see the decision of Dred Scott as it reverses
So as long as their rope is tight around Mumia's neck
Let there be no rich white life we bound to respect
Cause and effect, can you smell the smoke in the breeze?
My Panther, my brother, we are at war until you're free

[Gene Grey (a.k.a. What? What?)]
I plan to move my motherfuckers to the frontline, ready with guns cockin
We storm prisons, get the wards rockin
Snipe all the F.B.I. and cops clockin
Philly officials, bodies droppin
Offends the eighty-five, bombin
Eye for an eye, we'll hang 'em by the Capitol Steps
Snap their necks, snatch their vests, equip my children with techs
Free from the protected Feds, called it murder, legal execution shit
Free the righteous or face the bloody revolutionists song

[Tragedy Khadafi]
Yo, federal indictment, militant mind enlightment
Son, we outburst, in the court room, full of excitement
Face the jury, thugged out, with blind fury
They want us all under the jail, end of the story
Brave and heartless, we can have a million marches
But when you black you under attack, son, regardless
Live by the gun, dunn, and die by the gun
And revolutionize minds until freedom one

[Chorus: Gene Grey and Chuck D]
Somebody scream bloody murder, inside of my head
The executioner's plot controlled by the feds
Take illegal action, they want Mumia dead
This nation of savages been trying to kill us for years

[Hakim - Channel Live]
Yo, we watch wizards play games in Washington with your life
Swung with Spiderman, now we swing websites
W dot Hell's Kitchen, livin, ill condition
Body clonin switchin C.I.A. lynchin, Mumia trapped in prison
Marilyn Manson, mainstream, aliens visiting
My skin's a misdemean' with siren bee screams
Them wonder why the Live Channel got attitude
The times got us seated like zero degrees latitude

[Tuffy - Channel Live]
Can you keep a secret like society? The eye is on the rooftop
They got me under surveillence, like they had Biggie and Tupac
Yo, I saw two rocks, heard two shots, then level when my view drops
They grazed me, but didn't phase me, I fired back and hit two cops
For sure I, mumble through the jungle like Indiana Jones
With the key to unlock the science of microphones
Hit reverse, disperse, on stereo, planet Earth
because the first shall be last, the last shall be first

[Stic.Man - Dead Prez]
Yo, if Mumia dies, fires in the skies, rebel cries
We politicize, brothers with the lies uncovered
Look for me in the whirlwind, dare to struggle and here to win
Long live the panthers, comrades with answers
Freein all political prisoners of war, freein the poor
Open the door, keep your hands off our silence
Stop the 'ism schism prison economy that we live in
Impeach the president, keep on fightin until they give in

[M-1 - Dead Prez]
I say, "Fuck the Police," cause they been killin us for years
This ain't no free country, niggas get murdered for their ideas
Free Mumia means all Africans let go
Cause just livin in the ghetto puts you on death row
You don't know? You seen how the tried to do Assada
Till some real niggas organized theyselves and went and got'er

So fuck the government, C.I.A. and F.B.I.

[Divine Styler]
In the holy month of Rahmaddan, doin time, war and degrees
Within the means of God's speed, feel the supreme penalties
Black non-fiction, remains the weapon of choice
Reject the illusion of justice and white hears the black voice
The passion behind the vail, the flesh beyond the bars
Through the spirit of under force, who's deaf and who's cost?
Break the black man down in front of the black fam' and all
Guilty as you all, free Mumia Abu Jamal

[Last Emperor]
Shatan will destroy anything for the right price

No escape, fire, fifth burn, the execution date
shatter, We on the front lines prepare
I want Mumia out the cage the time for action is here

[P.E.A.C.E. - Haiku de Tat]
This is a P.S.A. to the P.S.C. and the P.P.D.
Mumia Abu Jamal must be set free
How would y'all like it if we took it to the streets in a discrete fashion?
Still smashin, underground arsenal of lyricists
Live from death row, 
we want the voices of the voices fully clothed and ready to go
And if not, you'll witness the largest uprisin you've even seen befo'
April twenty-fo', nineteen fifty-fo'...

(Get the flavor, get the loot and let's beat, jet it)

Intro:

What you do when you gotta make paper?
Kill to make a mill then people hate 'cha
Run that game kid before you go like vapor
Get that loot, save that legal shit for later

Verse 1:

If money is the issue
I'm rippin you like tissue
paper inspires the caper
Drape ya like curtains, hurtin in the individual
cos life in America's about residual
interest like my rhyme, Rolex says the time
Stack enough loot can legalise my crime
Like Don Corleone I'm on my way to Rome
Not to rock the microphone, to make a pick-up
Like April 15th I'm tellin y'all to stick up
Big up to my people, the hustlers in the field
It's about work, network cos it's time the nation build
on the lot, the government distributes drop
The mayor is on the corner so y'know we never stops
like pretty women rollin on my tip
I'm more than a player, I take the coin and flip
My own destiny reads G and my grip slip
To the car dealership where friends
do stacks full of Benz, co-sign for the Benz
Deep-dish rims is how I be spinnin
Is it a dream or a dream that we be livin?

Chorus:

Is it a dream or a dream that we be livin?
What you do, what you make, what you drive, how you livin????
Is it a dream or a dream that we be livin?
What you smoking, what you drink, why you sniffin???
Is it a dream or a dream that we be livin?
What you wear, who you wit, who honey you be hittin???
Is it a dream or a dream that we be livin?
Where you at, where you from, where's your gun, why you trippin????

Interlude: 

(Get the flavor, get the loot....
Get the flavor, get the loot and let's beat, jet it)
*repeat*

Verse 2:

There's always talk about struggle whether you speak it or hustle
The bottom line is get in your piece of life's puzzle
Whether you livin raw right in spite
The first law of nature says you gotta survive another night
Cos I a rules your ways and your actions
Non self-satisfaction, look at Michael Jackson
Caught up in materialistic, you can't shatter
cos your spirits trapped in a body which is matter
or should your pockets be fatter
Cos cash rules or are you just a devil's fool
Used like a tool, taxes paid?
I heard a white boy call another white boy "Yeah nigga, yesterday!"
Cos they slaves to the same beast
who wants Landcruisers, jeeps, guns, wars, MORE and MORE
I think it's a dream we're living thru deception
cos '95 is in a reality, it's perception

Chorus

Verse 3:

The loot gets got, pick locks or whatever
I'm too clever to start, heads get severed
from the neck, hold ya cheque, repect nuttin but the green
Credit ain't shit without CREAM, I mean I dream
American dreams caught up in illusion
I gotta get mines, what's the reason for confusion?
Drug-abusin customers praise more ways than bein
a demon for the devil, I run hell with my team and....

What you do when you gotta make paper?
Kill to make a mill then people hate 'cha
Run that game kid before you go like vapor
Get that loot, save that legal shit for later
What you percieve you believe and that's deceivin
That's why they tell you half fake break and keep believin
Believ in self, self-God and you can't be stopped
Got faith in rap and my religion is hip-hop

Typed by: Byg_Balla

[Verse One]
I'm loving life fam, we in the light man
Yeah that's right fam, another Christ jam
We get it hype man, I'm just a hypeman
Jesus the headliner, I'm just his hypeman
So get it right fam, It's not about your boy
But if you get the truth, holla at ya boy fam
My past was gritty and filthy like a trashcan
But through His blood, I'm cleaner than a snowman
This not a show man, but this for show man
At his wedding, he saved me for a slow dance
so I'm gon slow dance, down and narrow wit em
The whole way fam, like I'm hearing slow jamz
I sold program, this is program
Out wit the old man, in wit the new man
Follow the trails he left us like TuCan
Sam, 1 and 2, this one is for you fam

[Chorus]
If you walking down the streets
Or you ridin' wit yo top down
Reppin' on the front line
A soldier in the background
You face the trials of this world
And you don't back down
You hear the word of the Lord
And go and act out
You get down to the fathers biz
Want the whole world to know who Jesus is
If you loving the fact that Jesus lives
And the fact that Jesus is, Act Out

[Verse Two]
Let's keep it hype man, I'm just a hypeman
Yeah that's right fam, another Christ jam
Abundant life fam, we in the light fam
We just some broken vessels reppin' the God man
A tool in God's hand
Like Moses rod or the mic that I hold in my right hand
Like the Psalm that says word we delight man
Rejoice and we write man, all about Christ fam
Let's keep it moving
Don't get it tangled in everyday life, keep your focus on God's plan
Forsake the world's plan and the things that covet
Forget a Spring Bling fam and a Summer Jam, but this is Summer Jam
But believe me done I could care less if they bump this in their Hummers man
The plans for us is to shed light like a summer man
Before cats get knock-ed off like duh duh man

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
Yea that's right man, this that Christ Jam
Jesus the God man, seated at the right hand
Whether you walking down the street or at a light man
Sittin' in your room, about to make a right man
Gaurd your life fam, and forsake the things of this world
Keep your focus on God's plan
Because our life suppose to bring light man
To lead people out of the dark to the God man

Turn the lights on...
These hoes be actin' up, these hoes be actin' up
These hoes be actin' up, and these niggas be lettin' 'em
These hoes be actin' up, these hoes be actin' up
These hoes be actin' up, and these niggas be lettin' 'em

[Meek Mill]
Maybach...
These hoes be actin' up, and these niggas be lettin' 'em
I crushed them hoes, I never love them hoes and these niggas be sweatin' 'em
Cause I run shit like Edgerrin or better yet, like Rev and them
And on the bottom of my sneaks they red, man and I ain't talkin' 'bout no damn Meth and them
Stay Louboutin and I super grind, VS stones, they super shine
I pop the Perc, I get super high and I drill your bitch, root canal
I rock Tom Ford, Concords and I shine on these dime whores
This bitch done bought me a Rolex and I still ain't got no time for her
These hoes be acting up, these niggas be acting tough
I'm in the Phantom, I'm backin' up and I'm bust down, but I'm strapped as fuck
So hold your horses, Polo horses, Aston Martin, we roll in Royces
Real niggas up in the building; then hoes choose us, ain't no more choices

[Chorus: Rico Love]
These hoes be actin' up, these hoes be actin' up
These hoes be actin' up, and these niggas be lettin' 'em
These hoes be actin' up, these hoes be actin' up
These hoes be actin' up, and these niggas be lettin' 'em
These niggas be lettin' 'em, these niggas be lettin' 'em
These niggas be lettin' 'em, and me I don't be sweatin' 'em
These hoes be actin' up, these hoes be actin' up
These hoes be actin' up, and these niggas be lettin' 'em

[Wale]
Whatcha here fo'? Haha
Work.. work, young
Run 'em out then, haha
Double M-G, forever though
Hold up...

These hoes be actin' up, see me, I don't practice much
Gold albums from the word of mouth, gold bottles in the back of us
These Jones be broke as fuck, too uptight, they won't open up
She got her arms folded even on the phone: I'm like, "what the fuck is she here fo?"
These hoes be actin' up, these niggas keep wifin' up
Please homie, got me crackin' up, never spent one more than a night with her
These hoes be a fucking joke, they'll never say a nigga didn't warn you though
Cause you can hit my phone like four in the morning and I be like, "hah, told you so"

[Chorus]

[French Montana]
Wale, Rosay, MONTANA~!
I'mma, I'mma, I'mma +Coke Boy+ {*2X*}

These hoes be actin' up, big bread we rackin' up (huh)
Straight to the bank, cee-lo (huh), cancel that bitch like Nino (huh)
Ratchet ass ho, don't play with me, want to Kobe me, want to Humphrey me
Want to Michael me, Russell me, take me to the bank and Tiger me (ay, ay, ay, ay, whoo)
Now these hoes be actin' up (huh), these clothes ten stacks and up (huh)
These cars 100 racks and up (huh), these drums 100 rounds and up (huh)
Bitch, blow me, like a, trumpet, twenty, thousand, all in, hundreds

[Intro: Solomon Childs]
Yeah, this is it
The old school niggas is a wrap
You hear me? Boy!

[Solomon Childs]
Killa Bamz, the kiss of a curse, all squads and units
Should now look to purchase a herse
Wu-Tang, bigger than these bullshit record labels
We touch souls, all over the universe
Powerful movement, never rehearse
Name a rap crew, we ain't influence, it's time to reinburse
Or have the rigs roll in reverese, over your body
Til you see your bone prints in the dirt
And since I came out my momma feet first
The thirst got me anticipating the outburst
And all these gangsta rappers, you can't hide forever
Under them skirts, what you gonna do?
When a hundred Wu hoodies show up at your concert
And you on stage smiling, showing your teeth
Like Mrs. Butterworth, no homo
Will kick you in your dick til it hurt or til they scream 'red alert'

[Chorus 2X: Solomon Childs]
I want action (yeah) somebody better tell 'em
Somebody better tell 'em, tell 'em
Cuz actions speak louder than words

[Solomon Childs]
So let the vibe off the sinister rush your mind
Or be haunted like a voodoo shrine
Coast to cross the beat like an airline
A sign, to rip a new asshole in the bassline
I'm running my show rooms so fuck a co-sign
It's yours, believe it or not, you cock suckers
The world is mine, and I'm intertwining with a dime
With the smallest waistline, my cough get by
Harrowed a king in his time to redefine
The outline, set you off like Colombian caffeine
Dudes be so hard, til you hit 'em with the 40 with the beam
And they body get peeled like they swimming in clorine
And nothing changed, it's the same routine
Niggas is fronting like they strength long as limousine
But get burnt like nicotine in the belly with guillotine

[Chorus 2X]

Ok, go head boy, tell 'em man
Ain't playing with you muthafuckas

[Infinite]
Yo, fo' real
Y'all living in a dream world
Rexdale
It's a reality world right here, fo' real
Yeah
Yo I'm stuck in this organized crime life
Shook slingers get robbed blind
Soldier ain't afraid to do time
We run the range like a militant co-thug
Meanwhile on the streets, what I kill is just throw slugs
Supplying the corner, so them dealers can sell drugs
Now you see my block get hot
Rob or shoot and get shot
Police wanna know our names yo, that's why we stay low
I'm caught up between my music and street life
My blood is like my heart dear God
And my gat is my wife
This world is spinning into sicker times, thawing like ice
Hated female probation officers, they boook us for spite
I'm living fouler, ever since Squig lost his life
Hard cold stone, don't give fuck you get blown
Never talk my shit on phone ever since I came home
You puff your glass jaw, I puff my marley sit on the rail
You tell your untruth, I tell reality from Rexdale

CHORUS 1 [Infinite]
Material world (got me addicted)
Drug money corners (get me addicted)
Them sawed down barrels (got me addicted)
Guarding my heart (but still I'm addicted)

[Infinite]
Yo I got hit, ever since worse
No I never did snatch purse, example
My palm grips the pearl handle
Too many flaws in the way, that makes us disturbed
Like pulling out, broad daylight like I got some nerve
The only thing now, this music got my face baited(?)
This leaves me more risk 'round snitches and hipocrites
Place under warrents, they want me on the cell block
Trying to give me 14 years and keep me on lock
Surround my house, front and back in the night light Wishing to book me
Two in the morning but they can't find me, trying to look me
Ain't nothing much to say, after the street already hook me
I guess I'm addicted like my mind has took me (took me)
We be dealing with this physical, some lie regardless
Sometimes the bigger the grains who hit hardest
I never boast about it, be smart like the smartest
I wipe it off, I loaded it with leather gloves regardless

CHORUS 1
CHORUS 2 [Infinite]
My Rexdale blocks (got me addicted)
All them work nights (got me addicted)
Undeath fast money (got me addicted)
Guarding my heart (but still I'm addicted)

[Infinite]
I'm from the Rex-village, dollar signs who's quick to stick it
Run up in your house to be specific
Ain't nothing perfect or terrific, so lay down quick
Special delivery of open burn wound inflicted
I guess they like the way we dip it
Gangster walks, the way we talk
And the way we lie they down on they sidewalk
Face down on the rich block, mask up right to my eyelids
Stick and move quick, on the run like a fugitive
Stay communicated from back roads to pay phones
I never talk too long, I switch clothes
No time for normal wasting, wash vinegar inside your basement *echoed*

CHORUS 1 & 2

[Infinite]
Naw what I mean fo' real
Rexdale, naw what I mean
Where ever you from
Got you addicted
All my peeps locked down
Hold it down, naw what I mean
Keep the faith fo' real
All my peoples on the block, hustling
Peoples working, doing what ever you got to do
Doing what you got to do to survive
Keep doing you thing

Song:   If it Ain't Ruff
Typed by: dy_face@hotmail.com

[Verse 1: W.C.]
Dub is the rider, and you're just a hostage
So whenever you see me cover your head like an ostrich
Groupies been waitin for this, niggaz been hatin on this
You know why? - because so many are relatin to this
Jealous, started the feelings intentionally
But they start to love it because I made it eventually
Pumpin the music, I keep the music like pumpin
Cause Dub ain't in here for nothin, I got the killer starts jumpin
Yo, you know the color, Dub's in black
Always down, to make noise, and attack
So you better get back, unless you wanna come with it
And make your face like a target and close your eyes when I hit it
You're screamin with fear, but it's with fear that you're screamin
You're wakin up on a sweat, cause Dub is givin bad dreams and
Yo, I'm not schemin, I'm just kickin the facts
That's how it is when The Connect Gang starts to jack
So brothers, that wanna scrap with me
Cause I'm all blew down with my Khakis Crease
Especially beggin to write some lyrics with me
I just snatched your girl with this platinum heat
Cause when it comes to Dub there's no comparison
And if you tried to see me, it's quite embarassin
But I understand cause you're mentally slow
Cause I can tell from the jump, you're too nervous to go

[Hook: DJ Crazy Toones]
If it ain't ruff, it ain't me 
The Rider is back and he is about to attack -----> W.C.
If it ain't ruff, it ain't me 
The Rider  -----> W.C.
Give us a freestyle here 
Alright, man   -----> W.C.

[Verse 2: W.C.]
I can tell, that you're afraid to fight me
Simple because you lost the crowd, and they had to invite me
Because you're sweat as a puddle, but there's a puddle of sweat
I'ma threat, so wrap a cold rag and wipe your neck
And clean the dirt off your face that calls Acne
It's ridiculous thinkin that you can jack me
This is the round where the punch will go
Til your A G-A-B that's known as a blow
I'm makin a point, but it's a point that I'm makin
I'm never kiddin or fakin like Race, I got them shakin
Scared to speak with a tongue when they're chosen
The sound of my voice in your ear when you're frozen
This is a battle to the death, so why I bother?!
You can't see the G in the blue God father
Givin a pain, but it's with pain that I'm givin
But I'm comparin and tearin while I'm makin a livin
With the hype of the 9 millimeter
And a group Old Dees with the team of speakers
Now that, so others gettin bow "what's happenin?"
I'm from the streets so, yo, I'm ready to go
Come on

[Hook: DJ Crazy Toones]
If it ain't ruff, it ain't me 
The shadiest is back, nigga, hide your sack -----> W.C.
If it ain't ruff, it ain't me 
Let bust a freestyle here  -----> W.C. 
Alright, man   

[Verse 3: W.C.]
The + Do not Disturb + sign is on deck
While I'm thinkin of a fool to select
Givin the victim the verdict, so for the verdict a victim
Slammin my vocals on a dance with the rest then I kick them
Tell them they're guilty, and beep out the playlist
And get a new track from Dre so I can play with
Percussion; pumpin it loud when I bang
You wanna roll with Dub, you let your fly gang
It ain't a rule in my book you have to go by loc'
When it comes to cheatin you should know 
I keep fear in the hearts so they'll stay heart full of fear
Cause what you keep in your ear is somethin funky as real
The hump was incredible, for you Dub; he was shady
And all the West Side connected with niggaz got respect 
The soldier with my top rankin
Pushin dope material, motherfuck gankin "fuck them"
So play like the airplane, it just jet
And keep your blood pressure low cause I'ma threat
As of now, I'ma break out the show "Of this show?"
That you'se a bitch motherfucker and too nervous to go
Come on

Typed by: davpaul@dove.net.au

[Opio]
Rap slash out these battleship torpedoes that'll rip through
your fragile ego, ransack your evil empire like I was Genghis
The Khan/con artist, fiendish, on target, laser beam shift
Trackin your movements like The Pentagon
Disarm the meanest lookin studio prankster
Endangered, we airborne rangers with the broken language
Absorbin blows every game I strength (What?...)
The Chinese connection game of death
You might see me in the reflection in the chain on his neck
Controllin these mics while he aimin his Tek
Couldn't even hold it still cos his hands was all wet
Said we a threat cos we the heaviest
And with a strobe light in his progress you'll never be fresh
You can't murderlise a survivalist
Fool we thrive on this shit, the third eye is too swift

[Tajai]
All we gotta do is provide the music, ugh
Don't need a Lac on Deez to make your bitch hop on my lap
and lap on these, lavishin please don't tease
To all these way-below-average MCs
You gon' stay below, don't wish, that's just how it's gon' be
My style is on levels unattainable, recyclable and reusable
but not biodegradable so don't confuse em
They last eternal, evil gas that's acid turned
When I spit it, unmatched fashion over da riddim
Unabashedly, leave sights only extreme sides of gassing
Mic mastery, necessary steps to make you genuflect
I reflect the genuine and accept
nothing less than your respect in excess
I wasn't expecting the success that I met
When I grabbed my shit and left command
Won't let it get too ahead, I got a check on that
Check you spice rack, it's certain elements you lack

	[Tajai & Opio]
	We combust when we contact
	Come correct with the contract
	Show respect when we stomp packs
	You get cut for the combat
	Got the specs of your launchpad
	Snatch ya bitch when we rock that
	Interception, she out back
	Undressed off the twamp sack, blessed off the cognac
	Take her back, we don't want that, no not that

[A-Plus]
I don't rap for the money but I'm lovin that it pays well
Sometimes I kick a strange tale, make your brain swell
Souls tighter than lifers sittin in the same cell
I never listen to the drama that a dame sell
I'm tryin to make that mail so I sought the game well
I know the spell from the rattle of a snake's tail
When a hard nigga spray and the enemies lampale
I'm witta female that was waitin, make her exhale
I'm Double X-L like the magazine is
And fuck the drugs but I can show you what a rappin fiend is
Perhaps my team is NOT the type to act the meanest
but on my birth, you're just a falling Earth, you gettin smacked to Venus
Stings are jackin the penis so your label accept
cos you ain't able to rap or able to wreck
I'm claimin respect with rappin that'll strangle your neck
Claim you're a vet but still I'm makin you jet, shakin the set

[Phesto]
I'm unique with this on three hundred and fifty cubic inches
of horse-powered fuel injection, positive traction
Throttlin action, my prerogative's idlin
Mind bogglin speed tobogganin streets of Oakland
Old English Old English, the kingpin
Swingin like Charlie Miggetts, 
high wire torch, swallowin, spine tinglin
Break your vertebrae's with permanent turnicans
Firm burn your sternum like nerve gas and germ, warfare
Hor, d'oerve you serve, your Sequoia Heights in Stirling
Minted, quartered your terms is centric
Circumventin the industry
While your fate remains in the chains of imagery portrayed
And mass media hype, we smash media rights through mics
Crack through the core at the speed of the light
I'm ????? ???? ????, graffiti on mics
The beaters are white, forever sweet and precise for me to ignite 

	[Tajai & Opio]
	UGH!
	We combust when we contact
	So come correct with the contract
	Show respect when we stomp packs
	You get cut for the combat
	Got the specs of your launchpad
	Snatch ya bitch when we rock that
	Interception, she out back
	Undressed off the twamp sack, blessed off the cognac
	Take her back, we don't want that, no not that
	Never that

	We combust when we contact
	So come correct with the contract
	Show respect when we stomp packs
	You get cut for the combat
	Got the specs of your launchpad
	Snatch ya bitch when we rock that
	Interception, she out back
	Undressed off the twamp sack, blessed off the cognac
	Take her back, we don't want that, no not that, ugh

The hip hop Anthony Perkins
Constantly murkin'
For certain
Excuse me
Y'all say fo' sheezy
Dawgs like me be like "WE WANT EAZY!"
Tame One be talkin' greasay
This be Tame and D Day
Burnin' more redlines than eight major freeways (vrooom)
My motto is fuck you, don't follow!
Stunts who won't swallow'll get stunt tomorrow
Oh well, I still can't tell
You actin' beat bitch, beat it
No secret, I'll murk you half weeded
My bars are like Xanaxes
Broken down the force that bring down yours
Encyclopedia Brown kick it in Co . . 

[Copywrite]
In this most aggressive art form none a y'all bastards want it
'Cause I don't paint on the canvas, I slam rappers on it
Laughin' at clowns with they demos, passin' 'em out
Pass it to me, get it tossed to the trash with a smile
Bad Boy with a long barrel that's all narrow
Shyne behind bars like Jamal Barrow
You got a cast iron stomach
Let's see how strong it is when I cock this and blast iron from it
You flow sick but too slow spittin' your coldest
I'll come up with a cure before any symptoms are noticed
You tryin' to shit on me, it's a dream
I got a weigh with words like alphabet soup on a triple beam

[J-Zone]
You want a free verse, your label was a joke from the start
You want a free beat, then put a stethoscope to your heart
You want free dick, then baby go back to your ex
You want free advice, chump shave the back a ya neck
I use threats over money so DJ's don't play my jams
Internet b-boys wanna know what race I am
Black, white, or Spanish, you figure it out
Learn how to rhyme off mine and take my dick out your mouth
It's about to get ill in here so stop staring bitch
Old Maid Billionare, Christina Aguilera's pimp
UPS is hirin' so pause the trap
'Cause my old gym teacher ain't supposed to rap

[Cage]
I went to my grandmother's funeral fucked up in rush
Stood over that bitch, smelled embalming fluid feindin' for dust
My baby's momma taught my daughter to ask for paper
Told her Disney World blew up so I didn't had to take her
My engineer is a dominatrix tryin' to master me
My out of body experiences got dead cops after me
How my anti-pop records get played on tv
The explanation is the same as why you hate on EC
So don't be alarmed when you see and my soundman holdin' a firearm stompin'
some bitches for a skit I'm on
If my ex try to come to a show to dumb out
I'll make the crowd beat the shit out of her before I come out

[Mr. Eon]
It's Julius Irving with word fling
Mics inverting, fuck all you stupid Earthlings
Y'all couldn't shed light if y'all were the Sun
Wipe the cum off her head and take a load off her mind
One time could never invade my paradigm
From propaganda pamphlets to the asinine
Joust with mic stands, jump over Technics
My soul got caught up in mom's ovaries
No angel on my shoulder, just two devils
Feedin' chemicals pushin' blood past  legal levels
It's the accomplice who's too obnoxious to accomplish
Leavin' you rookie fucks astonished

[Skillz]
Yo, it's the G-h-o-the-s-t-writer
Conversin' with me, shit, it's like talkin' to fire
If you touch it it burns and y'all don't wanna do that
You can talk to it all day and it won't talk back
I still battle niggaz, so scrap ya plans
I ain't got to be in promotions to wrap your van
Cats two-way me all day to deliver a hit
But I ain't writin' shit down till they deliver some chips
If B.I.G. was here, he'd say I was "Dead Wrong"
'Cause I don't get on the radio and say verses that I said in the song

Tryin to hold back my smile,

Then they ask me again.

But you can't tell that ain't my style.
Not my style. Not my style.
But you can't tell that ain't my style.

Typed by: Lil Hustle

[Z-Ro]
Ain't nobody, really got my back
Motherfuckers just be hanging around me, because I rap
It ain't no love involved, no motherfucking love at all
If I had a price on my head, I bet my partnas would give up they dog
Wish my mama was living, cause I'd be giving her my time
Shit, I'd probably never would of started to rhyme
My lifetime it ain't no sunshine, cause it be raining
I be trying my best to smile, but I can't cause I be paining
I'm paranoid all day, I keep my steel with me, bitch ass jackers
Try to get me, so now my people be scared to come and chill with me
Fuck y'all, I'm one deep till I D-I-E
Displaying off some boxing game, when H-O-E's try me
An S.U.C. Guerilla Maab veteran, constantly head busting
Leaving em in need, of an exceteran, I'm going
Do' knocking with a glock, paying a visit to some of my foes and friends
Z-Ro Jones Jr., swelling em up around the nose and chin

[Hook - 2x]
Fuck all of y'all, y'all done pissed a nigga off
I'ma touch all of y'all, round each and every corner
Someone follow y'all, they just trying to give you a present
Something holla dog, and that's for all of y'all

[Z-Ro]
I done made up my mind
I hustle all alone, I'm trying to get a solo shine
Everytime I turn around, someone bringing me down
Got tired of em pulling on me, started slanging them rounds
Now they thinking, I'm a crazy
Scarred and stabbed and shot, I'm still a baby
I want my mama, cause I'm having bad dreams and I die in em all
Got me ain't friendly when you see me, ain't no smiling at all
Live the thug life, heartless and hopeless
Laying low ducking the law went North, you lusting and act-a-dochess
I'm connected, my best friend use to be I-10
Till my out of town connect, pulled out two techs and took my ends
Got me throwed off in the mind, retaliation's what I taste
His get blowed off with my nine, incarceration's what I face
Feel me, I done lost my mind, but I'm not trying to find out where it went to
It might be for the best, cause I'm not trying to remember the shit I been
thru

[Hook - 2x]

[D-Reck]
It's automatic gun fire, till they all expire
Of course they said they loved me, but they all was lies
Told me just give em a deal, now I tote a pill
But when it was forth and ten, only a few was real
Instead of making you an employee, nigga I made you a friend
Now look what you lose, your Q's and handle fections stealing your ends
I've been behind the scenes, but in front of the schemes
Organized the team, for you to realize your dream
That's how you pay me back, you funny fake fraud and flipper
Over pennies and nickels, they turned sour like milk
It's no wonder why, so many'll never see fortune and fame
Fuck what you claim motherfucker, you never endue it no pain
What you bumping for lil daddy, my address the same
Ain't no pain without no gain, you got the heart to sustain
Now I'm solo for the do'-low, ain't fucking with you no mo'
For one thing you do, and I'll have you knocked off for the low-low

Now we're here makin' love

This ain't just so that you'll be walkin' funny, no
Said it's your love and I'm workin' maintenacy
See you could be the armour and I could be the daddy
And you enjoy it a brother get what you need

Now we're here makin' love
It's for all of the abo-o-ove

I'm a kamikaze in a Maserati
I'm a John Gotti, got my own army
Worth fifty million and it's all on me
Fifty on my Roley knowin yours phony
Last problem I had, a nigga head shot him
Say the word on the street is that my man got him
If I wasn't involved you wouldn't hear about him
I got Lears and all - don't need Aaliyah problems
May she rest her soul, I got a sleepin problem
All my CD's gold, but the Visa darker
Bastard child but I got a fleet of cars
Double-M G this little thing of ours {M-M-M-M-M-M-Maybach Music}
Take it to the do' motherfucker please
Niggaz layin' on your crib while your momma sleep
Homecooked meals for the real niggaz
Hot Tec 9 for you little niggaz
Want to shoplift? Come and boost this
We run the fucking game, nigga truth is {Maybach Music}
Cargo pants and my red bottoms
Talking 'bout birds you know the boy got 'em

[Chorus: French Montana]
No clothes in the closet, it's all birds
No sneakers in the sneaker box, it's all birds
No luggage in the trunk, man, it's all birds
And I ain't goin back - I'ma ball first

[French Montana]
Anything you need you know I get it cheap
My nigga Rozay makes millions while he can't sleep
Cars European, come and see the fleet
We're commercial come and see us if you need the street
I'ma bring it home, nigga bet the bank
Sierra Leone all up in the link
'Bout to +Double Up+ some Mason Betha shit
Huddle up, round table, King Arthur shit
Shorty ass fat, she can't stand straight
Spent your down payment on my landscape
Niggaz sideways like the Phantom door
Hundred round drum sound like round of applause
Slicker than a can of grease
Paid the state and the ice hundred grand a piece
Coke boy, I'll be 30 for sure now
Coke damn near same price as dope now

I'm the Waterbed Kev and I'm here to say
Bout what's goin on in the USA
How the President's givin all kind of advices
But that don't stop the raisin in the prices
Candidates cuts each other's throat
Just to get poor people out there to vote
If you look in the sky, at the stars above
You read Waterbed Kev, he was made for love

Ladies, all night long
They wait for Kev, to come on home
And run to the roof, to shoot the juice
It's me that they love, they love me
You know that I can feel you comin
Yes my waterbed is runnin
All that I say
Is that it's time for you to lay, in my waterbed

	*chorus*

Helloooo, ladies
What's your name, your number girlll
I would like to get to know you
I'm Waterbed -- Kev touch his self, to prove that he's a freak

Some people go through rap, wit no style of their own
Being someone else instead, of being who they are, just like
She's like her, and he's like him, oh what a shame
Cause when you hear one rapper you hear the same
They sellin to mutual gain, to the ladies

Ladies, all night long
They wait for Kev, to come on home
And run to the roof, to shoot the juice
It's me that they love, they love me
I'm back, on your top, girls are waiting
Sometimes we go roller skating
They hurry up and come
Cause we can't wait, to get it on

And then it's what did Water say (GO!)

If you a freak, repeat freak what did water say (GO!)

Hey girl, would you meet me at the waterbed later on
Say about, 11 o'clock, and we can do it all night long firl
	10:30 sharp

You see my skill and occupation is rappin on the mic
The reason that I do it is that's what I like
Got the capabilities to do other thing
Bein a movie star, sportin diamond rings
Be a player, a hustler or executive
with a forty-room mansion, that's how I live
Eat the finest food, drink exclusive wine
Search for a girl to be mine all mine
Not lookin for a woman that's only sexy
Listen if I tell ya how ya have to be
Just honest, intelligent with sex appeal
Not lyin baby doll cause that's the real deal
You fit that description, you can't resist
After the party is over, sign up on my list
it's at the door, I wanna see the girls galore
Yes it's the girls, that I do adore

Since I took this time out, to tell you and yours
That I was the Waterbed Kev
And I get the stuff all night long
I just wanted to ask the girls -- how ya like me now?
(We love you Waterbed!)
I said young ladies, how ya like me now?

Beins that I'm leavin...

Goodbye, ladies! (Goodbye Kevie Kev)

You rock, my waterbed (he'll rock your waterbed)
Oh girl, you rocked my waterbed (his name is Kevie Kev)

Whassup Juice!

My outer-body experiences got dead cops after me
How my anit-pop records get played on TV?
The explaination's the same is why you hate on E.C.
So don't be alarmed when you see me and my soundman
holdin a firearm, stompin some bitches for a ???
If my ex tries to come to the show to dumb out
I'll make the crowd beat the fuck out of her 'fore I come out

[Mr. Eon]
It's Julius Err-ving, with wordsling
Mics inverting, fuck all you stupid earthlings
Y'all could shed light, if y'all were the sun
Wipe the cum off a head and take a gold off of mine
One top could never invade my paradime
See propoganda paphlets through the ascinine
Trounce with mic-stands, jump over techniques
My soul got caught up in mom's ovaries
No angel on my shoulder just two devils
Feeding chemicals, pushing blood past legal levels
It's the accomplice who's too obnoxious
To accomplish, leavin you rookie fucks astonished

[Skillz]
Yo it's the G-H the O the S-T White
A conversal with me, shit that's like talkin to fire
If you touch it it burns, and you don't wanna do that
You could talk to it all day and it won't talk back
I still battle niggas so scrap ya plans
I ain't gotta be in promotions to rap ya van
Cats 2-way me all day to deliver a hit
But I ain't writin shit down 'til they deliver some chips
If B.I.G. was here, he'd say I was "Dead Wrong"
Cuz I don't get on the radio and say verses that I said in the song
It's Mad Skillz muhfucker the V.A. don
E.C. emcee, AKA Shaquan

[Camu Tao]
All my niggas buggin out, wasted on drugs
Talk shit nigga, thug it out, ya waitin on guns
Cuz I'm a dirty nigga that likes the guts cut up
And put my hands in the heat until my fingers burn up
And pick my teeth with the remains when the bodies turn up
I'll stay rotten, stay plottin on ya bitch and her cunt
AIDS victim, stickin my bloody dick in the cup
Cuz I'm hotter than the bobbins and skillets in ya momma kitchen
I'm even hotter than the fuckin seat the Devil sits in
Cold shoulder niggas get blazed forever
And your heat'll never happen like rubbin to wet sticks together
You fags wanna fight and shoot its whatever...
Artist: Wu-Tang Clan
Album:  A.I.D.S. (America is Dying Slowly, a Red Hot Compilation)
Song:   America

Intro: Killah Priest, Raekwon

Continous
  Yeah, youknowhatI'msayin?
Wu-Tang
  Aiyyo aiyyo, come on yo yo yo I'ma shoot over here
On that AIDS thing
  YouknowhatI'msayin? I'm gonna just slide in the studio quick
Yo, yo
  And get this done

Verse One: Killah Priest

When you're sexually frustrated, plus waiting for a long time
You both had strong minds
Combined with feelings, she seems appealing
for each other, discreet lover, no longer keeps brothers
Smothered under deep covers
Erotic programs, Moet and slow jams
Enough to make you hold hands
And plus you a bold man
You fall in a manhole, where the forbidden tree grow
And bullshit ego, of fly negro
Whole garden sour, polluted with a dead flower
Months later, he's layin on a respirator
Depending on a generator, to keep his heart moving
And start losing sight in his right eye
In weeks he might die

Verse Two: Raekwon

Yeah, uh-huh
I know this dope-fiend cat, word up, his name is Javier
Part-time shooter sharing needles in the stairs
Wise guys disguised as a fly guy
you gettin high right?  Weeded up with red shit in your right eye
Youse a menace, your brain cells finished
Begging forgiveness, calling that up top shit syphillis
You know what you was gettin into
Try to guess on what I've been through
Fuck shorty raw then she scared you

Chorus: Raekwon

AIDS kills, word up respect this, yo
Coming from the Wu, it's real
AIDS kills, word up respect this, yo
Coming from my crew, it's real

Verse Three: RZA

My nigga Chuck, he loved to fuck
Everything exotic bitches down to ugly ducks
Like Nancy, who liked the fancy tickles
so he put popsicles on her nipples to make her sex passion
triple quadriple, until she bust
Overcome with passion, big ass want lust upon him
But nigga he forsake to grab the condom
Fuck it, he said AIDS, was government made
to keep niggaz afraid so they won't get laid no babies be made
And the black population will decrease within a decade
German warfare product against the dark shade

Chorus:

AIDS kills, word up respect this, yo
Coming from my crew, it's real
AIDS kills, word up respect this, yo
Coming from the Wu, it's real

Verse Four: Master Killer, Inspector Deck

Caught by the gravitation earth rotation
Six in the sex is deep, when you can't see clear
through the sheer brassiere, toke back
Smoking a spliff, sippin cognac, God
you know my two love songs, Bobby Womack tracks
Got her fat ass layin flat on her back

Yo, as she lay, she wore a silk gray neglige
Alehze pours, the radio play, Marvin Gaye
What's Going On? As she screams Sexual Healing
Couldn't fight the feeling her legs hit the ceiling
Hittin all positions dipped in for quick love
She's professional she does this shit in strip clubs
Flied in June until she Acquired Immune Deficiency
Now misery is the Syndrome

Outro: Raekwon and others

Oh shit, God that's wild
Damn, that's some cherry flavor shit going on though kid
For real, knowhatI'msayin?
What about the exotic type
Caskets is waitin for brothers
Word up slide on the joints baby
Before you go to sex take protection
Word up

AIDS kills, word up respect this
America Is Dying Slowly (4x)

Yeah, word yo, sliding up in this store right here
I ain't even playing that man, for real
Dig it
Respect how I'm living kid
Here forever, word up
Lubricated joints, ribbed joints is bangin
But they still playing the hotel door man
Word, you know how that be though, you know how that be
Yo, just gettin to be too old
Chick over there lookin like Sonny and Cher
Over there
Yeah
America Is Dying Slowly
Surely
America Is Dying Slowly
America Is Dying Slowly
remember that! Syndrome, be the resident
America Is Dying Slowly
Wu-Tang, Syndrome, be the resident

Noodles, Bobby Steels, Lou Diamonds, Killer Priest
Rolly Rollie Fingers, Johnathan Blaze, Maximillion

[Soopafly]
It ain't shit like ridin' wit my niggas, watchin the world time
Down to spend every last dollar I earn
It ain't nothin' but a thang to a youngster
It wouldn't be the same if the paper wasn't amongst us
I used to wonder what the funk was
The Bigg Homie said 'Give em what they want cuz'
I can't remember gettin high as a muthafucker
Walking by not saying hi to muthafuckers
Little mama told me, don't get it wrong its the truth, but I
Prefer to have a nigga like Soopafly
Believe me I'm goin all out
And niggas trip when they see me up at Dogg House
And every time the Bigg Homie comes through they rush
My nigga truck windows down, not the move, givin it up
We live it up, so we don't stop for shit
We Dogg House in your mouth, where the props for it, come on

Chorus:

A nigga like moos best not make that move
Unless, you rockin wit the Dogg House best
Affiliated, trust, no niggas fuckin wit us
Many hate it but at least they strapped wit heat
They make it false tabloid, you froze back
These niggas must be on crack
Thinkin they can fuck around wit the cost of the town
They love to boogie, uh
One tough cookie chocolate chip dip
Wit the rockin this bitch hit top wit this hip-hop
And it don't stop (don't stop)
I make a lady go damn near crazy, I wanna treat ya lazy
Cos my bones tryin'a go like the disco age
And when I'm finished wit your bitch I'm like get on baby
And look its no maybes, about the game I pack

O danger, niggas give me five minutes of fame
To show you why you should be use all kane, check it out

[Intro: Ghostface Killah]
Yea, that's right
It's not a Hardy Boy mystery neither
This is real shit
This shit  come on right after Hart to Hart y'all
No doubt, 7 o'clock Fantasy Island
This episode is "Death to a Brooklyn Man"
This is Toney's Angels

[Ghostface Killah]
Ayo, it was 3 white bitches who worked for Toney Starks
Undercover agents far beyond narc's
Amazed by their beauty marks
Wonderwoman bracelets, knee-high boots that was made by Clark's
My dick got hard on how they spoke and shit
Every language was music to the kid as if
If I was modern day King Midas
Doreen, Sky, and Kelly
Starks Angels, Shaolin's Finest
Though it happened in the streets of Brooklyn
Plus I played the whip real low
cuz my face was woofin'
My Angels jetted outta Albee Square
Gun out, wrapped in they hair
Kinda crowded so they clapped in the air
Chase a nigga down, block for blocks
Squeezin' glocks
These Mami's real anxious to blow of his top
He's a rapist, murderer, convict, burglar
The more they ran, the more they skirts got dirtier
Sendin' shots like Check Day
FedEx Express way
**Boom!, Bow!, Bing!** You heard the gun play
*Who shot the duck out the window*? Mr. Lee said
*Three pay now, you fuckin' weed head*
We can stop the fire, the suspect, he's dead
Then I pulled up - "Come on girls to Club Med"

[MF Doom]
Stay tuned - The Villain Threes Company
Don't Sleep Pt. 1

2 Brown sisters assisted the Villain Doom
He woked up, stoked like they was still in the room
Freed his right arm and leg
It was more like a sweep
Loosened his other leg, arm, head and rose to his feet
Staggerin' except for the socks and mask naked
Grabbed up the boxers, fussin', pissed and
checkin' for the keys, stacked
A robbery expected, yet nothing obvious is missing
Recollectin' now why Hollywood hotties
Stepped in Giuseppe Zanotti, personal nurse's
Chanel purses, she ok? shottie
Chased Patrice with Thai iced teas
She drive wild nice to Veggie Fried Rice Spicy
Told the Hoes "I don't feel so well, my belly"
Rolled down Melrose, "Drive me to the Telly"
"Ya'll go'head and get the L's, and get back, I be 'k"
Feelin' woozy, no oozy, who's seen the lobby? Ray
Peace! peace to man, change 100, stop and look
Naw! Whoops! Left a knot in her pocketbook
Elevator slow, "is I'm that careless?"
Entered the room and fell flat on the terrace
Woke up, dag, who bound and gagged 'em?
Got 'em for 2 out of 3 packed bags Magnum
Each gram of Villain sperm streets worth a G
The part of Mr. Furley was played by Charlie Murphy

[Outro: Ghostface Killah] & (MF Doom)
Fuck Charlie, that's right y'all
we go get back out there on the scene
Kelly you go get me some pussy
(To be Continued)
You know what you gon' do
You too Dorien
You lil fat ass can't get away neither and shit
Uh huh, that's right yea I'm call The Theodore niggaz
Swat Team alert and shit
uh huh, yea that's right
Sky you can't hide baby, you got the best head nigga
Word up, This real Angels shit, y'all my bitches
Toney Bosley in this bitch nigga, word up
Give me back my boots, motherfuckers

[ODM]  99, 99
       Hey yo Yogi, why don't you come with that shit homey

[Yogi]
Wake up in the morning, shit what are you kidding me
My mom's a bitch, she don't feel like hearing me
I gotta take a leak so I put on my house slippers
Gotta shave my dome so I grab my clippers
It's sunny as usual, another day to put it down
And all the dust settled in my town
I got happy when my dog got out
I had to run him down about who was shot out
I pumped down the mix and why I got out
I gotta make this money man, that's what it's about
So from the East County to the South Bay
To my posses on Broadway, it's Dago and problemas
Nobody move, nobody get hurt
I got riders in the storm and the outskirt
It ain't nothing but a word from the mero mero
Ain't you Yogi? I see you heard my demo

[Chorus]
We do what we do homey
But is you gonna keep it real Yogi
Shit, about as real as it's gotta be
Cuz we gonna do what we do homey
But is you gonna keep it real papi
Shit, about as real as it's gotta be
Whether chilling out in my zone or packing my chrome
We gonna do what we do mami

[Yogi]
Gotta make some phone calls to see what's up for tonight
Gotta find something fresh for me to sport for tonight
So I shoot to the mall, I hear my name being called
Cuz everytime that I go I see somebody that I know
My pager's blowing up so I gots to use the phone
It's the homeboy from Low Pro talking about a party in the zone
And Royal gots some hynas that wanna kick it with us
But more than likely dog we're going to the club
I gotta get creased up before the homies pick me up
I gotta get hectic so I'm pumping the homies up
Now we're South of the border, straight thugs and hoochie mamas
We use a broken bottle when we meet some drama
And it's guarenteed, so won't see the baby's mama
And the DJ keep on spinning and the spot be getting hotter
And me and my homies torn the club down because we're fools
And yeah yeah, We Be Clubbing like Ice Cube

[Chorus]
We do what we do homey
But is you gonna keep it real Yogi
Shit, about as real as it's gotta be
Cuz we gonna do what we do homey
But is you gonna keep it real papi
Shit, about as real as it's gotta be
Whether chilling out in the club or getting some love
We gonna do what we do mami

[Yogi]
I bump beats and write raps trying to make mula stacks
Got all the homeboys asking where the hynas at
We flipping U-eys for hoochies, I'm watching you jock
As I shoot through the zone, old school hard drop
Chicks scream out the window like they're long shot
As I lean to they side they throw the bone eye
You see I'm not a player I just crush a lot
You see I'm not a gangster but I'll rush your spot
I be knowing about them broads that talk a lot
So we pull over and post up at the taco shop
Hey yo Yogi Bear be buzzing off that bacardi hard
I'm thinking to myself dog we gotta make it pop
So while these chicks be jocking us we tell them follow us
Back to the spot cuz we bound to rock
Stopped to buy some brew and a bottle of malibu
Cuz we're gonna do what we do when we do it

[Chorus x2]
We do what we do homey
But is you gonna keep it real Yogi
Shit, about as real as it's gotta be
Cuz we gonna do what we do homey
But is you gonna keep it real papi
Shit, about as real as it's gotta be
Whether chilling out in my zone or packing my chrome
We gonna do what we do mami

Y'all gon' fuck around and make a nigga go crazy
Y'all don't know who ya fuckin' wit, baby
Y'all gon' fuck around and make us all go crazy
Say...

[Verse 1]
Yo
I roll wit niggas that blow `dro and blow holes in yo torso
Deveras, mama, te digo la verdad
I ain't tryin' to impress ya just to get under ya dress
Nor am I tryin' to worry yo ass to leave you caught up in stress
I'm The Real Mc Coy, I'm as real as they come
Other niggas can talk about it, but nigga be silent wit their tongues
Instead of yappin' gums, how they be holdin' guns
How they be sellin' drugs and how much niggas give `em love
Don't they know that I don't give a fuck about what they got
Braggin' about yo shit in front of me can get ya just got
I ain't playin' no games, I done said it before
I'm taking niggas' platinum plaques and puttin' my shit on they walls
I'm like the...
Best kept secret, that nobody knows
Only movin' about in these streets and carried out by these hoes
See some niggas out here, they only care for themselves
My and my niggas are the opposite: we catch this bread well
And if cats don't realize this, they ain't compliant
Never had no real cheese up in they muthafuckin' pocket
Papa taught me never be greedy, wit the money you hold
But watch out for fake niggas, and them gold-diggin' hoes
Now these are the words that I'ma live by, till the day that I die
Fuck the nigga that doesn't understand, and has to ask why
Has to ask why, has to ask why, fake ass muthafuckas have to ask why
Now...

(Chorus 1)

(Chorus 2)
la la, la la, laaaa, la la, la la, la la, laa laa, la la, laaaa
Now all my thug muthafuckas say...
la la, la la, laaaa, la la, la la, la la, laa laa, la la, laaaa


[Verse 2]
Ay yo I'm tired of being broke, and not havin' nothin' to show for
I'm tired of poppin' ecstas. sippin' on too much liquor
I'm tired of niggas makin' promises they can't keep
I'm tired of all this stress that's unablin' me to sleep
I gotta...
get on top of things, make some moves in this game
Anyone can lay the track, but only I can bring the fame, and for as
long as I reign, I'ma bang on the brain
Makin' it hard for modern niggas in the streets to complain
Listen to the ones who, smoke Lala, and sniff up all the powda
And sell it for hot dollar, and don't give a fuck about nada
Gemini, the greatest, I'ma ball till I fall
And I'ma, reassure your thought with a fuckin' plaque on the wall
Mutha-fuckas...

Y'all don't know, who ya fuckin' wit, baby
Y'all don't know, who ya fuckin' wit, baby
Say...

They just need convincing like Malcolm little 'fore he converted
I'm on my grind, I'm on my deen Inshallah, I'mma get 'er right
On the bible you can run but you can't hide

[Chorus]

[Pill]
Marching for cause, they put a hole in it
Start the applause, a rebel soul lifted
Preaching for the paper, paparazzi, federales
Several rallies, mass, Allahâ€™s teachings through Shabazz
Thatâ€™s Malik Omaha, Nebras
Corruption over cash, leave them leaking in the caskâ€™
Ain't better, you better rebel, smell cheddar and shells
Malcolm envision platinum in Africa when he sat in a cell
My religion the kitchens, papa formulas
Benjamins to make sure my pockets abnormal
My philosophy is rocks and weed, a pot to lean, the Glock will squeeze
Niggas clocking dollars donâ€™t know how to read with mouths to feed
Itâ€™s hard when starving Marcus Garvey messed with Malcolm Little
Knowledge was obtained, fuck your chains and your master nigga
We in the field building muscle while you watch the house
And dusting off the porcelain and open when their cock is out

[Big Bank Hank]
I'm Big Bank, I am the Chief
I got a lot of raps but I'll be real
I never need a horse I like to chill
so I, drive up in my new Seville
My Tribe went down in the hall of fame
Cause I'm the one who shot Jesse James
Pound for pound, I will never break down
(Big Bank!) No sir, I don't mess around

Awowowowowowowowowow!!  Ho!
Wowowowowowwowowowowowowowowowowow!!

	[Chorus]

[Master G]
Like Kemosabi, of course it's me
I'm better known as the Master G
A firing squad, sensed the danger
When they're stung by the rapping ranger
Had a little talk with my medicine man
He said, "Get them squaws, fast as you can"
To all you girls, that wanna join my Tribe
Just move to my rhythm, and feel my vibe
Put up a fuss, in the end you'll agree
When you come inside, my tee-pee
As I said before, you could sense the danger
When you're stung by the rapping ranger
When Silver and I, take a route
All you suckers better step aside
I sting squaws, then I run away
HIYOO Silver, is what I say!

Ho! Ho! Wowowowowowowowow!
Hit it gang!

Ho! Ho! Ho! Aowowowowowowowowowowowo!

	[Chorus]

[Wonder Mike]
A pow-wow, just rock it out
Finger poppin to the break of dawn
Keep it rockin like the stuff that we call maize
(What's that?) Hot buttered popcorn
You just hippa-hoppa-dippa-boppa bang the boogie
woogie betcha wanna boogie again
And you can put me to the test at your request
I rock you out of your mocassin
Kemosabi got down, took off his mask
He kicked off his shoes and did the Monster Mash
Tommy came along, saw what was happenin
His head began to boppin his foot start to clappin
Go slam, dunk, do the jerk
And with the mic is how my smoke signals work
They were jammin off a record that said it best:
"Now what you hear is not a test!"

Aowowowowowowowowowowowo!
A-hunga-hunga-hunga-hunga (2X)

A snake charmer? Your best work yet
However this next job will not be so easy
Zen Yi has become a thorn in the lion's paw
This is what happens when you send a bitch to do a man's job

[Intro: Killa Sin]
One-two, one-two, yes sir, turn me all the way the fuck up
Let's go, yeah, Killa Sin just came home
Shout outs to The RZA, my physical Power Cypher, love you boy

[Killa Sin]
Yo, they call me the drama starter, heart stopper, llama popper, I gotcha
Gangsta impostors, calling the coppers, and ducking the rockets
Optic, digging my pocket, cock it, empty your block, bitch, you hear me?
The semi toxic, like, Remy that's rock less
Have you swiveled up and shot, said, no screaming, I'm shot, shit
Like Pusha T and Malice, muthafucka, I got clips
And shells that'll lock lips for kicking that Pac shit
Then slam through your body like they stuck in the mosh pit
A born again, rebel in the flesh, do it to the death
Bleed heat, meaning I won't rest, til I'm fluid less
Niggas be like 'yo, you the best', nah, I'm just one of them
These faggot ass rappers be running, like I pulled the gun at them
Call me daddy, I'm sunning them, bad, burnt badly
Sign suckers up for Gangsta Academy, so they mad at me
A g checker, reject quick, demand my respect
Like D-Set, made bird niggas dip, I clear your p-jects
Yeah, your boy sweet techs, not steps, head shot
See neck, knees, chest, long as them bullets meet flesh
You subpoena to meet death, Killa did it and beat death
I dance with the devil, right now I'm letting my feet rest
Talk a tough, go bonkers or bust in a monstrous conquerors crush
Comp to dust, fuck a niggas sponsors up
Diamond cut rhyming in my prime, blind a miner
Steady digging in my styles for one liners, none finer
Ensign a compromise, word bond and brothers honor mine
Sorta like spans, like Father Time, hard to find
Another artist that go hard as I, and I got a heart divine
Read niggas like march of dime rappers, don't get shot for trying
Everybody wanna shine, my fire one of a kind
Inspire brothers to rhyme, soon as I utter a line
Gun ho, Mighty Joe Young blow, gorilla bars
Killa far from a corner, dying amongst the realest stars
Known for giving niggas scars, goon work, my wombs search in twos
Inserted in your private parts, you can die tomorrow
Better yet today, you better pray for better ways to get away
When my Beretta spray, I'm known for giving lead away
Young fuckers the head of gray, here's man, I swear
I can send you to a better place, where nobody can set a trace
And tears for you cheers, throw your hands til your shots fired
And rot in peace til ya'll police lovers rocking wires

[Soopafly]
Ay yo, if ya don't know now you know
I shine bright, Willie Dynamite, sit back watch the show
I'm forever rockin' the mic, sometimes two times a night
Examples for niggaz who can't get it right
I shook suckas and fleas, buckin' up cheese
The last thing I told a bitch nigga please
it's a brand-new day for me
Way too G from A to Z, not where the haters be
I feel it's my time to shine
Bling in your face until you're blind, matrix your mind
Visualize, look what you'll find
No more time, these uh days niggaz die for rhymes
I cock back-forth, with told the force 
I u-turn 'em off they course and run 'em from South to North
Huh, East-West, each chest get wet
I'm not biased or vexed, I'm just tryin' to keep it in text

[Chorus]
Ya bitch nigga, I came to fuck up your day
(Are You Ready?)
I'll make it hurt like oww-oww
I got somethin' to say
(Are You Ready?)
It's about to get raw, for bitch niggaz
I came to fuck up your day
(Are You Ready?)
I'll make it hurt like oww-oww
I got somethin' to say
(Are You Ready?)
Are y'all ready for this shit?

[Soopafly]
Bitches only want me for cash, I know it
I quarterback like McNabb, don't like to throw it
Keep it run my selection
I just like to fuck for free 'cause payin' for it's no fun
Trick bitch, stay out my car
Cause this bus pass will take yo' ass just as far
Don't fall in love, I'm not with you, I pick and choose
I'm on your screen daily like Pikachu
Beat it, you are just a hoe
These words comin' from a cutthroat nigga just to let you know
Here it go, I'll flip the game
Watchin' bitches shake they booty is the reason I came
Let it go, there's nothin' to blame
You talk about pimpin' a bitch but she got yo' last name
Let a hoe run game on you, shame on you
I came on her, that means I came on you

[Chorus]
I came to brighten your day
(Are You Ready?)
I'm not blind bitch, I know your kind bitch
I got somethin' to say
(Are You Ready?)
I keep my hoes in check, I got they panties wet
I came to brighten your day
(Are You Ready?)
Oh it's me girl, what you wanna see girl?
I got somethin' to say

Y'all ain't ready for this shit...

Armani, Armani
I keep a cray sem' on my hip like I'm Ronnie
Breezed up in Philly
I'm in my Ace, I'll be surprised if you spot me
You just need a splash in the game
Well guess what I just made a tsunami
Givenchy, Armani
You look at my swag and you can't even copy
Used to ride in a Honda
Transformed to a 550, feelin' like Optimus
I'm killin' these shows
Left and right ain't nobody stoppin' us
My city, they love me
My family party all night to my accomplishments
Now I'm performin' with daddy
And I got your girl in the cold, in line for it
Armani, Armani
They said they gon' rob us but when they gon' do it?
Sneaks are Armani
My women Italian, I just left my new chick
People is talkin'
Like "Who is this lion and where is his music?"
My dad been tourin' the world
I moved in the booth, my friends I was losin'

Think you must be out your mind
Soon as I wake up I only focus on them dollar signs
I ain't on the corner but I hustle, gettin' major rich
On Instagram I see y'all hatin' on me, talkin' major ish

Raekwon the Chef, U-God, Ghostface Killah, Masta Killa
And the Me --- yeah, yeah, come on, now, now

[Method Man]
What's happening? Who get it cracking like a neck snapping
For the rapping, and who them fellas packing yelling Staten
From the background, I back down a few
Try to clown us in the past, where they at now?
I'm ill as baby powder with the smackdown, for the record
My brain is like the project projected, for the Method
Go see my nigga Kush, he got the best shit for burning
This one go out for whom it may concerning
Spending they entire earning, trynna get a higher learning
MC's is vermin, like E be Sermon
Ya'll too determined, feeling yaself like Pee-Wee Herman
While we at it, let's tighten up our grips around that cabbage
Silly rabbits, how many kids'll trick you out your carrots
Little bastards and ghetto bitches, I break you like a bad habit
My dick is, zoo, and just too big for it's britches
Uh, so fuck a mister and your misses
Cottonmouth niggas etched out like Merry Christmas, that all
Uh-huh, be home

*bell rings*

[Method Man]
Knock, knock, who is it, Tical I pop digit
My block too hot to visit, round here, you gots to live it
MC's, you must admit it, I'm deadly on this mic life
Think back on this premise, anyone of ya'll can get in
I breeze, backwords sleeves and THC
I bleed, kamikazes and forty OZ's
America's Most, the better the smoke, the better the quotes
For cheddar, Meth'll sever the throat, whatever the coast
I'm home, let the sun shine on, get his grind on
And get some phone time, everytime I'm in your timezone
Look here, it's crooked letter I, ya'll don't meet nothing but crooks here
It's hot in hell's kitchen, get your cookware, for goodness
MC's is like that shit chicks be gushing
For pushing, got me tooken down to Central Booking
I stick out, as if Tical just walked up in the party with my dick out
And I'm prepared to take the shit I dish out

"When you realize that what you got ain't what you want" - sample

[GZA]
On the, yo, on the expressway, suddenly, I un-hit the breaks
A mistake, patrol figure just, ran the plates
I pull to the shoulder, a half mile ahead
The vibe got colder when the marksman said
"Yo, you in the truck, get the fuck out your car
Put your hands where my eyes could see, not far"
A fat slob, with pepperspray in the canister
Donut shop lounger, nine mil brandisher
Plus my half pound just rang the bell
Of the bloodhound, had an acute sense of smell
I guess he was tired of the strip and booking whores
Moving off a tip he's claimed he's looking for
Some MC's wanted for a string of break-ins
Last seen wearing lonk minks and snakeskins

Beat Street Breakdown, rrrrhaa!

Beat Street, the king of the beat
You see him rockin that beat from across the street
And huh-huh, Beat Street is a lesson, too
Because ah, you can't let the streets beat you
Uh!

Well, a picture can express a thousand words
To describe all the beauty of life you give
And if the world was yours to do over
I know you'd paint a better place to live
Where the colors would swirl
And the boys and girls can grow in peace and harmony
And where murals stand on walls so grand
As far as the eyes are able to see, ha
I never knew art till I saw your face
And there'll never be one to take your place
Cause each and every time you touch a spraypaint can
Michaelangelo's soul controls your hands
Then serenades of blue and red
And the beauty of the rainbow fills your head
Crescendo colors playin tunes
Man why oh why you'd have to die so soon?
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
Where the good die young is all thy must
Cause as life must live death must die
And the tears shall fall from the living eye
Huh, teardrops fall for the state of mind
Of the beautiful lady that you left behind
In love and alone, but now you're dead
And she still can't get you out of her head, huh
More tears fall for all you've done
Tried to be a good father to your only son
But now who's gonna make sure that he's fed
Put a shirt on his back and a roof over head?
Tell me who's gonna dream the impossible dream
Of the beautiful cities and the island's ( ? )
When your works of art brought into being
All that the ghetto stopped you from seeing
Bums on the sidewalk, garbage in the street
Abandoned buildings, bricks of concrete
The ladies on the corner are sellin that body
And everybody wants a part in that party
I'm hangin out tough rockin late at night
Runnin wild in the town of the neon lights
You either play some ball or stand in the hall
Huh, you gotta make somethin out of nothin at all
I'm sittin in the classroom learnin the rules
And it says you can't do graffiti in school
That can't be wrong in the hallowed hall
So my notebook turned into a big wall
The heart of a lion and the courage of three
And the mind of a man much wiser than me
You're the soul of the brother who won't come back
Who died in my arms on the railroad track
Cause I'm caught in a rat race lookin for my own space
It gotta be a better place for you and me
There's pie in the sky and a eye for a eye
Some people gotta die just to be free
You search for justice and what do you find?
You find just us on the unemployment line
You find just us sweatin from dawn to dusk
There's no justice, it's, huh, just us
Still life urban masterpiece
Your trademark was written on trains and walls
A million dollar gift only God released
Huh, and yet you got killed for nothin at all
So after this there'll be no more hard time
No more bad times and no more pain
No more chump change, none of that bull
Just movies, museums and the hall of fame
So all you hip-hops, get on up
And let's take it to the top where we belong
Cause the age of the Beat Street wave is here
Everybody let's sing along, now come on
And say hooo (Hooo)
Say hooo (Hooo)
And to let me know I'm rockin the microphone
Everybody say Ramon (Ramon)
Ramon (Ramon)
Rrrrhaa!

A newspaper burns in the sand
And the headlines say 'Man Destroys Man'
Extra extra, read all the bad news
On the war for peace that everybody would lose
The rise and fall, the last great empire
The sound of the whole world caught on fire
The ruthless struggle, the desperate gamble
The game that left the whole world in shambles
The cheats, the lies, the alibies
And the foolish attempts to conquer the sky
Lost in space, and what is it worth?
Huh, the President just forgot about Earth
Spendin multi-billions and maybe even trillions
The cost of weapons ran in the zillions
There's gold in the street and there's diamond under feet
And the children in Africa don't even eat
Flies on their faces, they're livin like mice
And their houses even make the ghetto look nice
Huh, the water tastes funny, it's forever too sunny
And they work all month and don't make no money
A fight for power, a nuclear shower
A people shout out in the darkest hour
Sights unseen and voices unheard
And finally the bomb gets the last word
Christians killed Muslims and Germans killed Jews
And everybody's bodies are used and abused
Huh, minds are poisoned and souls are polluted
Superiority complex is deep rooted
Leeches and lices, and people got prices
Egomaniacs control the self-righteous
Nothin is sacred and nothin is pure
So the revelation of death is our cure
Peoples in terror, the leaders made a error
And now they can't even look in the mirror
Cause we gotta suffer while things get rougher
And that's the reason why we got to get tougher
So learn from the past and work for the future
And don't be a slave to no computer
Cause the children of Man inherit the land
And the future of the world is in your hands
So just throw your hands in the air
And wave em like you just don't care
And if you believe that you're the future
Scream it out and say oh yeah (Oh yeah)
Oh yeah (Oh yeah)
Rrrrhaa!

Gettin' more pushy, when it comes to fuckin' 'em dames
I'm crushing ya frames (Yeah)
Loving the pain
Lust for the fame
Thinking like they know I'm a name
Yes
(???)
I'm feeling feverish
I'm rhyming over the hottest beats, can't get their knees off this

Hook: MCOS
I gets hip hop head
You can catch me in the back seat, making a mess
I gets hip hop head
Yeah, shorty really want me, wanna take me bed

Repeat Hook

Repeat Chorus

[Lucky Luciano]
I'm on vacation, call me Luck W. Bush, baby
And not only am I the hot butter with the toast
But I'm also a pace po' person for Steak-N-Shrimp Records
Ya feel me? 713

(Verse 2)
I been sippin' and puffin', gone, end of discussion
Playa Made Mexican in the door, gettin' his money
Lucky Luciano 'bout to open a school
I'm out the H-Town, baby, yeah, the home of the Screw
Slowed down, chopped up, wet paint, dripped out
Codeine and Xanax, know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Handle bar-popper
Lorenzos with choppers
If your money right, you can borrow my boppers
Gotta hit a lick
Mix up the sip
Better swish it up, the fire and sticks, I'm a dip
Tip down slow in a farm machine
Wood wheel underneath the bagets on my ring
Red Ben, on a black glock, right there on the stash spot
Run up my damn drop, you gone get your ass shot
Million dollar Mexican ain't having it, G
I done wrecked the microphone, so go on and pass me the weed

Repeat Chorus

[Ese Daz]
Check it out, you know what I hate the most?
When them bitches be lyin'
Bitch stop lyin'! (You need to be real)
Ha ha ha

Pre-Verse: Ese Daz
I love sex in the morning, sex in the evening
I'm a freak everyday of the week
I love sex in the morning, sex in the evening
I'm a alcoholic, sex freak-aholic

(Verse 3)
Ever since my birth, I was born to fuck
Arellano my last name, with the lust in my blood
I'm overdosing like I'm on drugs
Sex with no love
Got good hands, man, they call me The Glove
I love touching women from the beginning with foreplay
Like Frank Sinatra, I do it My Way
On the highway, gettin' some brains
Doin' 40 on the freeway, man, I'm swervin' them lanes
Everyday, holmes, we grind
Gotta make the feria, man
From nickles, quarters and dimes
Gotta hustle, get it, man
I'm on a Mexiclan plan, tryin' to get rich
Being a player money maker
It's just my human nature

If you really got a thing for a bad, bad girl
I'll give it to you, ow
Oh na na na na na
Oh na na na na na

I'm looking for a boy
That can make a lot of noise
When the trouble is going down
I'm looking for a dude
Who can get me in the mood
With a real big bank account
Break it, you can fix it like MacGyver
Brady buddy, act just like his father
So tell me you're the guy who about the life
If you are, then I'll turn you out

I'm looking for a hot boy
So I can be a hot girl
If you can be a bad boy
Then I can be a bad girl

I'm looking for a hot boy
So I can be a hot girl
If you can be a bad boy

Look into your eyes
I know what's on your mind
You wanna have fun
I can give you what you want

Give it to me
Give it to me proper
Give it to me
I won't even stop you

Just tell me you're the guy
You're about the life
I give it to you all night long

I'm looking for a hot boy
So I can be a hot girl
If you can be a bad boy
Then I can be a bad girl

Freaky, freaky love in the morning
Freaky, freaky love in the morning
Let me be your bad girl

Freaky, freaky love in the morning

Let me be your bad girl

If you really got a thing for a bad, bad girl

*car approaching*
I'm a bad man, bad man

[Chorus: Ike Dirty]
I'm a bad man, givin bad men
Bad looks, prince amongst thieves and crooks
Want bad women, bad cars, bad hoods
Bad duels, I'm makin my own rules
I'm a bad man, givin bad men
Bad looks, prince among thieves and crooks
Want bad women, bad cars, bad hoods
Bad duels, makin my own rules

[Ike Dirty]
I'm a bad man, haha...
Go to sleep now, could wake up, in trouble
I'm a bad man, bad men, bad looks
A prince amongst thieves, murders and crooks
Juvenile from a good kid
What up about a felony, and wake from a life bid
If I was born blind, being daddy's hustlin child
Damn, I was born to be proud
Ain't nobody gon' stop me
I want it all til God shut my eyes, and they bury my body
It's almost over, run...
I'm talkin to you, ya don't want nothing wit me
All day, all night, front of the store, my daddy's format
Tustle on his corner, hustle on his corner
Killas ran in his house, tied his spouse
Cocked her in my back, in a little boy mouth
Been *fucked up* every since, Scar Murderer
Brought me and bust me, a gun e'i since
Roam the streets, no love, the streets...
The streets, change me

[Chorus]

[Outro: Ike Dirty (Rikishi)]
I'm a bad man...
Wish ya don't want follow me
Nowhere to go, nowhere to hide
Haha

For life

Watch out
I'm a bad, bad man
Ike Dirty...
Go to sleep now
Like this part...
You know where to find me...

Song:   The Baddest Man Alive
Typed by: Cno Evil

[Dan Auerbach]
I can take the pitchfork, from the devil
Keep a super suit like I'm incredible
From the deep blue sea, to the dark blue sky
I'm the baddest man alive
I'll grab a crocodile by it's tail
Handcuff the judge and put the cops in jail
Make the meanest woman break down and cry
I'm the baddest man alive

[Chorus: Dan Auerbach]
I'm the baddest man alive
I'll take no measure, and I'll take no drive
Sometimes I feel like I can fly
I'm the baddest man alive
I'm the baddest man alive

[RZA]
Not bad meaning bad, but I'm bad meaning good
Say my name three times, and you knock on wood
Candyman hooks, I'll terrorize your hood
Flashing macs on a cop, the way a gangster should
I snatch food from the mouth of a tiger
Take a gasoline bath, then I'll walk through fire
Bear hug a grizzly, suck milk from a titty
Take the sergeant hat from his head and use it for a Frisbee
Spit in a crocodile's face, have a menage a trois with two female apes
Then sleep in the barrel of butcher knives
I drink honey, straight from the bee hive
Bungee jumping off the Empire State, butt naked
Rollerblade across the Golden Gate, butt naked
With the baddest man alive, and I don't plan to die
When the grim reaper come out, look him right in his eye
I'll bust off in the face in the witch of the east
Tell a great white shark to go and brush his teeth
Hehehe, I'm the man who stole the golden fleece
And I'll date rape Beauty right in front of the Beast
The baddest man alive, and I don't plan to die
Come on, somebody

Hey yo, give me stocks like brokers
I'm killin all you chumps with the choker, the big joker
Holdin trumps while you gettin broker, so callate la voca
I like my coffee black, give me cream to make it *Primo scratch*
Any challenger, can get hung like a calendar
and changed by the month, I remain in the front
I don't fuck with fakes, never ran from Jakes
Style be High like the Stakes, gettin cream like Drake's Cupcakes
No mistakes, I wouldn't play myself
like all you MC's and get thrown in Ricki Lake's
Cause I ain't Jones-in like Jenny
Plus I keep it real like when Janet was Penny
I be a master, Ed O.G. with that nigga Laster
Holdin MC steel, and we're movin right past ya
with forty-four thousand ways to blast
Cause a nigga gotta do what he hasta

	"Knock you off balance... good!" *cut and scratched*

[Laster]
What up and down, crews fall and count the losses
In Hell you forced the spell with metaphorcial forces
Now microphones, fiends for my vocal tones
Twenty-four grown, run it down one day know right from wrong
I master my opponents, lift the scene success
Succeed in so much verse, you in this biz so bless
Money I roll like ?fresh dern traces to North?
for surgery, *Primo doubles words and makes this incomprehensible*
.. this to get down *Primo doubles words again*
.. then none, or present to run youths while you done done
Now steel notes down your bodystructure, the masterpieces
*Primo doubles words again* .. just like fishes
And ?vicious?, no ran-on like sentences
when my mind spray *Primo yet again* game crime style can't relate
so bring the ruckus, darkness, sheistiest niggaz to spark this
I turn em harmless when I'm rhymin niggaz gutless
The unstoppable, Laster, money bring heat, I laugh
the Omega, they kills my path to Mr. Backdraft
Cause MC's get drags like fags, holdin a six-six flag
When the mind get open kid I swept em off the ave
Lift your face with one flow and on that blow
swallow your fonts now you shittin steel out your asshole

	"Knock you off balance... good!" *cut and scratched*

[Laster]
Only the strong survive, but the slickest be the richest
I throw my shadow with an echo, full moon status
Naturally hit trees of buddha, we got props like a new do
?On lingaling portables? make crews not know where to run to
So when you enter, learn to get burnt
And overstand the realness son, and some few good tunes
cause faces of death, will form a target on your jacket
The wanted mack ?spread beans?, approach you like a fuckin Deadpool
Like I'm Magnus cops roll, tried to bag us deep
in the corner of Blue Hill, wide open steel scared of us
What?  We see no fuss, knahmean?
And chicks get bagged like grocery, try to get that meal on real
Crews run sort of like blacks on blocks
Gun don't stay silent, at these rhyming grooves off balance
6-1-7 mass massacre scar you for life
Ghetto survivor son, leave two in your secret box

Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

One two
Comin for you
Yo yo yo

Last night, I didn't know what to write
so I broke my pen in half, in a violent rage
Opened my journal, then let the ink bleed on the page
until it formed a sihlouette, of me on stage
Still abstract, like unidentified objects
Find my name scrawled on the walls of your projects
like hieroglyphs, written in cryptic form
to forewarn the comin apocalyptic storm
I dreamt of fire, swallowin this wicked empire
and saw the entire world hurled into destruction
With their inequity, trickery and corruption
Caught you with your pants down, in the Oval Office
when the Messiah came, without an introduction
Too late to escape your fate, though many have tried
The pens have been lifted, the pages have dried
It was all prophesized like comets, droppin from the skies
causin earthquakes, and whole cities to capsize
My peoples dyin while you tryin to save the Earth
You need to stop lyin and SAVE YOURSELF FIRST

Still, they wonder why, I chant the battle cry
It's not that I'm anti, it's just that I can't lie
The only thing I stand against, is ignorance
but you call it hate, when I advocate, self-defense
What's the battle cry?  ?? ?? ??
What's the battle cry?  Allah U Akbar
What's the battle cry?  ?? ?? ??
What's the battle cry?  Allah U Akbar

Now put the Ak' on, as I presume to rock on
Leavin spots torn, whenever we lock horns
Come battle me, and that'll be your last mission
When you hear the boom, assume the crass position
Somebody tell my opposition, stop the mission
Mental giant's about to drop science, listen
.. to the ancient tribal drum
Close your eyes and nod your head and the vibe'll come
from the base of your spine
.. to a place in your mind that transcends all space and time
The legendary lonely wolf roam the prairie
Hug your kids tight, midnight, quite scary
Under fire, movin through this concrete jungle
Feelin trapped, wishin I had a gun, with nowhere to run to
I hear helicopters, I see buildigns begin to crumble
I feel somethin hot -- I've been shot!  I stumble
I blackout, then when I come to, I'm trapped
in the concentration camp, with a government stamp
Some type of microchip implant
made in the factory, that's what they use for trackin me
So if I try to escape, over the gate
the guards will attack, and put a bullet in my back
They stripped me of my identity, my name, my religion
Now I'm just a number in the system
Holdin on to nothin, but my convictions
and cold steel bars, waitin on Jar Jar to lick them

Still, they wonder why, I chant the battle cry
It's not that I'm anti, it's just that I can't lie
The only thing I stand against, is ignorance
but you call it hate, when I advocate, self-defense
What's the battle cry?  ?? ?? ??
What's the battle cry?  Allah U Akbar
What's the battle cry?  ?? ?? ??
What's the battle cry?  Allah U Akbar

Still, they wonder why, I chant the battle cry
Still, they wonder why, I chant the battle cry
?? ?? ??, until the day I die
Allah U Akbar his name I glorify

Still, they wonder why, I chant the battle cry
It's not that I'm anti, it's just that I can't lie

[Chorus]
I'll be cool, oh woo
Y'alls a fool, oh woo
I'll be cool, oh woo
Y'alls a fool, oh woo

[Moka Only]
Why am I the one with aches and pains still taking trains
Making pays, taking great leaps of faith
I'm the world's greatest durable mammal ain't nothing safe
With the "Lime Green" phantom but when face-to-face
with the best of y'all thrown in my path
It's hard to be the nice guy, I'd rather show you my wrath
Everything's so patterned and wrinkled it's disgusting
Plus most music today sucks trust me

I'll be cool, oh woo

[Moka Only]
But that's another issue let me rip you off of this (?)
Cash ain't sticking, ex-girl tripping
The next girl drive me up a wall she a chicken
Sticking to kicking them out of my life
It's like a sticky predicament I'm proud of my vice
But yo, the only thing I trust is my crew the
Battleaxe Warriors bitch I thought you knew

I'll be cool, oh woo
Y'alls a fool, oh woo
I'll be cool, oh woo
Y'alls a fool, oh woo

[Moka Only]
Ain't nothing amusing about confusion
Like who's doing what to make my shit poppers useless (useless)
Certain people slept and missed the train
When they should have just puckered up and just kissed my brain
I'm a full-grown genius with music
The west coast most prolific was high producing
Ain't nobody do shit for themselves
We did so we sell while y'all sit on the shelves
Ain't nothing bohemian no knowledge of elves
Ain't cutting graffiti Kangols and Gazelles
I used to do all that stuff, it was cool but time change
I do it different and you still say I'm strange

I'll be cool, oh woo
Y'alls a fool, oh woo

[Moka Only]
It's your loss
You don't seem to realize the cost
Living life as if your eyes are crossed
And I ain't really surprised at all
You could never keep your fingers crossed
Some things just meant to be and eventually
And if you can't deal with that…I can't help you
I spent tedious hours while the world sour
The things I do just to get away from you
Trying to pull that now or never, it's never going down
But your crazy ass almost put me back to level ground
(Y'alls a fool, oh woo)
You can't trick me, telling me you did lickity-split
I'm out clickity-click it's that simple
Don't try to invade the planet temple
I'm outta there without a care or my underwear

Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

Let's go fellas, shower time's up in five minutes
* sounds of prison bars slamming shut *
Get those feet off the table, whaddyou think this is, home?

(This is bullshit - yo son let me get a ciggarette)
	(I'ma go.. back to my cell and read)

That's it - five more minutes and that's it
Back to work fellas, back to work!

[Dead Prez]
Yo, lil' Kadeija pops his locks, he wanna pop the lock
but prison ain't nuttin but a private stock
And she be dreamin bout his date of release, she hate the police
but loved by her grandma who hugs and kisses her
Her father's a political prisoner, Free Fred
Son of a Panther that the government shot dead
back in 12/4, 1969
Four o'clock in the mornin, it's terrible but it's fine, cause
Fred Hampton Jr. looks just like him
Walks just like jim, talks just like him
And it might be frightenin the Feds and the snitches
to see him organize the gang brothers and sisters
So he had to be framed yo, you know how the game go
Eighteen years, because the five-oh said so
They said he set a fire to a a-rab store
but he ignited the minds of the young black and poor

	Behind enemy lines, my niggaz is cellmates
	Most of the youths never escape the jail fates
	Super maximum camps will advance they gameplan
	to keep us in the hands of the man, locked up

(Hello?)			Collect call from Nes
(How are you?)			Yo shit is crazy Boo
(Have you been alright?)	You know I miss you
(I feel lonely lonely lonely)	Yo woman..
				can you put some money in my commisary?

Lord can't even smoke a loosey since he was twelve
925 locked up with a L
They call him triple K, cause he killed three niggaz
Another ghetto child got turned into a killer
His pops was a Vietnam veteran on heroin
Used like a pawn by these white North Americans
Momma couldn't handle the stress and went crazy
Grandmomma had to raise the baby
Just a young boy, born to a life of poverty
Hustlin, robbery, whatever brung the paper home
Carried the chrome like a blind man holdin cane
Tattoes all over his chest, so you can know his name
But y'all know how the game go
D's kicked in the front door, and guess who they came fo'?
A young nigga headed for the pen, coulda been
shoulda been, never see the hood again

	Behind enemy lines, my niggaz is cellmates
	Most of the youths never escape the jail fates
	Super maximum camps will advance they gameplan
	to keep us in the hands of the man, locked up

	Behind enemy lines, my niggaz is cellmates
	Most of the youths never escape the jail fates
	Super maximum camps will advance they gameplan
	to keep us in the hands of the man, locked up

* speaking in spanish *

You ain't gotta be locked up to be in prison
Look how we livin, thirty thousand niggaz a day
up in the bing, standard routine
They put us in a box just like our life on the blocks
	(behind enemy lines)
You ain't gotta be locked up to be in prison
Look how we livin, thirty thousand niggaz a day
up in the bing, standard routine
They put us in a box just like our life on the blocks

Song:	They Wanna Be Like Us
Typed by: pthijssen@freemail.nl

Intro:
Let me go ahead and do this shit man
Now, this shit is often imitated,
but never duplicated
Now, you know Death Row was the first one,
to spent real money on video's
The first Niggas to be hoppin' in 6-4's in video's
The first Niggas to really have some real label love
We talkin' bout Niggas puttin' real ice on necklaces
Niggas really doin' things
House parties, Niggas drinkin' all 40's
You know what I'm sayin' now
Niggas are often imitated but never duplicated
And you know why Niggas doin' that shit
Because they wanna be like us

Kill 'em all x7

Verse 1:
[The Realest]
The way the story was told
I was murdered at 23 years old
Who ever started the lie
was it to possess my soul
Can understand, 
cause I'm the realest Nigga on the planet
Lyrics, I only have no choice 
But I try to ban it
Death Row
It be the label with the cash flow
And when you saw me motherfuck
say got no place to go
I scream Thug Life
Sideways into the grave
Money over bitches is the motto
And keeps me paid
With Top Dogg
We gon' be the boss Hogs
Cause the last ? Nigga never fall
We got 'em fall
Now time to stay
I rather go out in the burnin' blades
A holocaust or in the source
I make the front page
I'm suicidal on songs
But that's the life I lead
Too much alcohol and drivin'
So now I bleed
Who do I need in my ?
>From all the sinnin' that I done
It's to me kinda hard
A hard job
I often robbed when no penny came
I had no choice, 
but to switch into a different game
Give a fuck
Because I live in a rush
But all I know you motherfuckers
You wanna be like us

Chorus:
[The Realest]
So many Niggas wanna be like us
Stayin' strapped 24-7
I ain't afraid to bust
And my Glock got trust
I put you all in the dust
Understand this is a game,
full of money and lust
Whut
So many Niggas wanna be like us
In a rush to spray ?
As we come for with hush
There's no one else that I can trust
So I grab my Glock
And then I bust
Nigga

Verse 2:
[Doobie]
Framed milli in the F-1, 50
They can't catch me
See I play the mob Nigga
Nigga like Joe Pesci
Don't test me cause you got me
I'ma tug the Smiff-N-Wesson in my Versace
I ride ya, who got ya bitch
A been body in the Benz
Sippin' Gin on some 20 inch
Die
So in fluid now we do it
Pull it in bombs and blew it
?
A bad ass fluid
You I'll just march to us
We mob Nigga surchin' ?
You shouldn't have bombed us
What the fuck you figure
Diamonds glassin' why no passin'
Messin' in my figure
Want more Tommy than Hilfiger
Screamin' Death Row Nigga
So I figure
It ain't no need,
to put the hush on this shit
You motherfuckers tryin' to be like us
Nigga quit
I put that on the circle bitch
Or be us

Chorus:

Verse 3:
[Top Dogg]
The Niggas wanna be like us
And be like me
Alias name the Top Dogg
The dopest MC
Bangin' through you speakers
With the Realest, the Realest
Tight flows doin' shows
And they fools can't stand it
Standed on the row
Bow down to the C
Fools wish they could come like this
Servin' much heat
Don't try to copy the image
Don't try to copy the style
Got Niggas up 24-7
To stay in my profile
The Row ain't dead Nigga
The Row still kicks
Got Niggas outside
Tryin to dress up like Suge Knight and shit
Cashin' hard
Don't forget platinum plus
On video's and trust
With no hit hands are bust
Ain't nothin' to it
We just do it
Again and again
Tell ya momma, ya daddy, 
and ya closest friend
The last circle may tips, 
and kicks lick dust
Cause all y'all fake ass Niggas
Tryin' to be like us
Nigga

Chorus: x2

Outro:
[The Realest]
Aye, you know what
Aye, check this out
You know we the first ones
To wear our motherfuckin' 
read record label on our necks
On our chains
All you Niggas who did that
Y'all copycats
We started it 
Death Row started wearin' our
motherfuckin' read record label on our necks
Give us much respect
Big budget video's with the baddest hoes
We did the shit first
Double CD's
We make y'all motherfuckers drop to your knees
And copper please
This Westside
This how we do it 
We put it down with the best
Nawmeen, you better give us our respect
Are you disobayin' the Row Nigga
We don't fall out
We had to sit back in P.A. for a lil' while
And see what you other motherfuckers was doin'
Now we back
Bigger and stronger
And gonna last a whole lot longer
It's Westside Nigga
>From the Southside Nigga
We gonna let you Niggas know what it is
And what it's gonna be
Don't touch us
We can't be touched
It's the new Death Row
We got a new logo too Nigga
We givin' Niggas lethal injection Nigga
With perfection
Know what I'm sayin'
We givin' Niggas lethal injection Nigga
With perfection
These motherfuckers wanna be like us
These motherfuckers wanna be like us
Nigga, whut
These motherfuckers wanna be like us
These motherfuckers wanna be like us
Hey

[Intro: Rick Ross]
If Michael Jackson was alive right now
He would want us to smoke one for him
Double M, Self Made 3, let's go...

{*crowd cheering*}

[Chorus: Wale]
Folarin in this ma'fucka
I'm just talking to you ma'fuckas
If I don't make you niggas proud
Then this should never be allowed

[Wale]
Look, misunderstood, just over heads
Just in your ears, although you deaf
Killing my fitteds with no intent, I grew 'em better
Like I'm under a goal post, I am too official
Extra point nigga, I forever kick it
As far as lyrics I'm quite content with celibate living
Wittingly unfuckwittable with these syllables
And fuck your syllabi, lil nigga been to school
The realest dude in the room in my groove
And all my women come frequently as the summer's moon
Keep talking 'bout ambition shit
Brown women, brown liquor, I'm innocent
And all these bitches don't know which body part they gon' pick
Invite them to my mind but they end up on my dick, haha
Reminiscing upon my man Slick
We from the jungle, the grimiest animal a pig
As-salamu alaykum though
Try to hit the Jummah, Muhammed said you faking, though
Somebody said "you winning, why BOA pray so much?"
I said "you tripping, such winners make niggas pray on us"
Dreams fulfilling they ain't capable of
As I renovate a model but do raise up your cup
Tell them niggas we never giving up
And never lose us on this never ending revenue hunt

[Chorus]

[Meek Mill]
Uh, I did it for my family
I'mma take my mama to the Grammy's
And shoutout everybody that ever said that I can't be
And show her everything that she taught done came in handy
Yeah, everything fine and dandy
Hurricane flow, dropped my album it was Sandy
On another level so they couldn't understand me
I guess I gotta take what I want like Meyer Lansky
Shore is 'bout to get back, put your feet up and sit back
Barely went gold but I got money just like I went plat
You get that? Look like I went diamond where my wrist at
I eat a nigga first four bars without a Kit Kat, pause
Let me get that, oh, how you get that far
Cause when I ran out of gas I had to push that car
And when I ran out of cash I had to push that hard
Like Chris Paul when he push that ball, you dig?
I ain't even used to look that far, you dig?
I learned to hustle when I took that loss, I did
18 when I took that charge
Time to retire old niggas like they did Brett Favre, you dig?
New flows and new hoes
Now I'm switching Ferrari's just like I do clothes
I run a business my nigga, I don't just do shows
I don't just rhyme nigga, all I know is grind nigga

[Rockie Fresh]
I'm looking at the plan like this shit might work
But if it don't work then this shit might hurt
We made first and goal now we gotta convert
Gotta get a couple mill, then go for dessert
I'm tryna break the bank, I ain't breaking the news
That negative attention be the reason we lose
Instead of paying bills niggas wanna buy shoes
If it's money over bitches, is it that hard to choose?
Give these fuck niggas some fame
9 times out of 10 they wouldn't even sustain
You can tear they ass apart and let the pussy remain
Until the industry fuck 'em and then they no one again
I always been me, I was never ashamed
I understand that no man's path is the same
And when you not lying you’re even harder to tame
If you ever tell the truth then you free in the game
Yeah, nigga don't be a statistic
How your main bitch sending me pictures?
Feeling futuristic might buy me a Fisker
Or a time machine to make the process quicker
I ain't with the waiting but I stay patient
I take work trips, I don't take vacations
I'm headed to the top where I stay stationed
Yeah nigga, I stay stationed
And I ain't with the drama, don't look back for that
The flow got more crack than the trap you at
I'm done with bitter bitches, it's a wrap for that
If your a angry bird, it's an app for that
I waited for a minute for this plan to hatch
And now I'm back with a brand new batch
Yeah, and it feel good when it go like that
I spend quick and make the dough right back, uh

[J. Cole]
This verse never before rehearsed
it was wrote on site to slit a nigga throat on sight
Took a whole lot of punches like the Cotto fight
Cole world, zip your coat up tight, I put your soul on nice
Illiterate, the boy don't write
Never met a beat that the flow don't like, it's cold
Young CO, L.E. call me Neo
And If I ain't the one I'm the prototype
Woo, insane how I rhyme
All I do is brainstorm then I rain down lines
Shame y'all lying, me I'm the truth
Dog eat dog world nigga we on the loose
Niggas don't wanna hang, I'm the tree, I'm the noose
You lil pups couldn't pee on my roots
Touch the beat, oh, I could be a masseuse, thoughts black, I should be in
The Roots
While y'all foulin', me I just shoot
Fallon, Jimmy, nigga
Ask for it nice, now it's gimmie nigga
Once poor now it's plenty, nigga
Still want more/Moore, no Demi, nigga
Serve niggas quick like Denny's
Got penny's for my thoughts, now look what I done bought
Did the most with what I was taught
A Carolina nigga bound to be the greatest is a helluva start

It's Cole.. World.. nigga
Double MG, Dreamville shit...

Song:   Big Up
Typed by: nelly@itis.com

Big Up to black big up to ballers and the coniac 
Big up to B-Boys who spend hours in the record raps
I hate these out of space MCs who think they're complex
I'll tie a duck MC up and pour acid down his lyranex
Chased by Him because his was his beginning
Federal Bureau couldn't even figure out his ending
No case pending, my style I'll swing it like a pendulum
This track is like Yohimby it gives me strength
when I be swimmin' in the
P vector, lighter is ya like it wetter
Can't front ya your punn give me joint slender
I like to bend her over while I roll a
Nother liz and take a sip from my cola
Mixed with Ginsing and Bacardy 
I despies a duck MC who who on the mic think he the life of the party
Skills are evident my steelo is timeless
It's a shame how the majority be def dumb and mindless
Like tires when I perform I get's the nicest
My vocal skills like knowledgy delf son it's priceless

Hook:
Big up to black big up to ballers and the coniac (x3)
Big up to cash stacks ballers and the coniac     (x2)

Verse 2:
Like an SP1200 you can't replace me even if you play saftey
I'm still scoring touchdowns with contracts
I start well, see we a cartell together forever drinkin' Martel
On the rocks twistin' L's nonstop
Pop a bottle of V.S.O. and start servin' up the shots
That ? love that's how I do 
I'm paid in rube big up to Fat entourage and all tape master crew
Never expire or retire burn a duck MC like fire
Don't be mad if it's Defari that your girl admire
Money your wired off that smack because it's skills ya lack
Stop being gassed by the devil and come back to black
Double barrel blast shot lyrics to your brain
Code name Defari hey Ru birth name's Dwyane
Always a soldier giving thanks to Allah
I know the journey's long prepare to go far
These duck MC's be like bacterial infections 
My remedy are antibotics lyrical injections
The imperfection is the mic in the wrong hand
Of the man who's skills are soft like quicksand
I maybe put it to a rest I fot the Henny on ice
I'm nice prolific type lyricist

Hook

Verse 3:
Lyrics are gold plus steel for the raw deal
Feel MC's and DJ's nuff respect y'all real
Low caps I rock on the regular
Brim covers my eyes so ducks can't see their predator
Facefirst when I disperse yet another verse
To peirce your brain like a vision from Lucifer
Meanns I get evil wicked 
Thickness I stick it
I'm in the game to make my name fame like Wilson Pickett
Light that ass like Roy Jones when I be stompin'
Big up to all my peoples Uptown all the way to Compton
Stack and stracks in 95 equals greenback for Defari hey Ru
And E-Swift nigga your mad phat
Fact the shit we make be designed for the truck 
Word to Redman Da Bump we want your whole car frame to thump
And vibrate, I love it when sister's gyrate rewind tape
Press to wax now put in record crate
There's no debate Defari's status be like Cashous Clay
If you got beef then we can do this shit the classic way
Round for round pound for pound I'll astound
With the mic I kick the steez ducks bite forever now
Fuck the bullshit the mic stand's my pull pit
Except I don't bleach I reach and rip another fool kid
Now I need to lay in steels you know the deal
A duck MC's nemesis his antithisis the mad skill

[Chorus: Ace Hood]
Okay now guess who's back, in a black Maybach
With a black card on me, better know it’s straight like that
My nigga we black on black (black on black), black on black (black on black)
My Rolex gold, but know my strap all black
My nigga we black on black (black on black), flag all black (flag all black)
Put it all on that, my niggas gon’ ride for a fact
Yeah homie we black on black (black on black), black on black (black on black)
One thing that’s fact: I’m rich and black

[Gunplay]
I put black on the paint, I whip white in the sink
I put work on the pike, I ain’t scared of handcuffs and links
Only thing that petrify me is no money in bank
I'mma Chevy out there sprayin' bitch, I’ll jail bite the crank
I’m a shark out the tank, I don’t bark I just bite
Keep that K all day, don’t walk up on me I'll put that knife
All gold Dayton spokes strokin’ the pavement slow
I did that ho a favor and she paid me back in throat
I told the kitchen they wasn’t cutting the loaf
Butcher knife on the shelf like, “Where the fuck the filet mignon?”
Take a close look at my face, the war paint is on
Stuck my dick in the world, now I’m raping this song, I'm wrong?

[Chorus]

[Bun B]
Man I’m sitting in a black room dressed up in a black fit
I’m cleaning my black guns and loading my black clips
Count from one to fifty, that’s a fully loaded mag (mag)
I pick it all up and put it in a black bag (bag)
Put on my black gloves (gloves), put on my black mask (mask)
Pop my trunk and load it up and jump in my black Jag (Jag)
Sipping on black Hennessy out of a black flask (flask)
And best believe that I’m coming to get your black ass (ass)
When I pull that Mac out, they know I’m finna black out
They start hitting fences, taking alley ways and the back route
I caught one of 'em slippin', put that thing up to his back
Pulled that trigger on that nigga (man), and all he saw was black (black)

[Chorus]

[Ace Hood]
Okay now black lil nigga, in them all black denims
With a Mossberg pump that'll have them sleep in your liver
Better watch that shit that you say, my goons don’t play
That black Glock 9 never leave my side, no way
I keep that strap when I pray, even when I bow head to say grace
Any nigga bring beef my way, better let that 4-4 spray
Yeah nigga that’s black on black, my whips all black
That Ghost don’t fold, them four Diablos on that
And I keep that black Louis bag, racks on racks
My bitch so bad, Chinese and black, yeah
I’m a wild young nigga, getting rich off rap
My Rolex fitted, spent about sixty on that

What are we fighting for for? Ah, ah
What are we fighting for for? Ah, ah
Why can't we make love, not war?
You beat my heart in two, you
Made it black and blue
Black and blue
Made it black and blue
Black and blue

Never thought our love, would turn domestic
I've finally had enough, I won't accept it
I can't let you put your hands on me
Be damned if I turn, the other cheek

What are we fighting for for? Ah, ah
What are we fighting for for? Ah, ah
Why can't we make love, not war?
You beat my heart in two, you
Made it black and blue
Black and blue
Made it black and blue
Black and blue

All our sticks and stones, finally turned into more
Now we have to go, and cover up another scar
We did more damage, than we had
One of us goin' end up in jail
And it won't be me

So what are we (fighting for)?
What are we, what are we
What are we

So what are we (fighting for)?
What are we, what are we
What are we

What are we fighting for for? Ah, ah
Why can't we make love, not war?
You beat my heart in two, you
Made it black and blue

Cause you wanna roll with a real nigga like me then go and slang that dick
like hoes to a fiend, fuck throat when I lean
Take long on a purp, mad hoe on the beam
Still money over these hoes
Got Y.S.L. on my clothes
And blood drip on my sneakers
Nigga you hatin on me, she chose
And I ain't fuck your girl she rolled
My stick shift she drove
Did everything that she 'posed
I pulled my camera out and she posed
And I was like God damn, drop that, pop that
Got the top back, on a drop back, I'm back
In a glock, where the crotch at
I'm strapped where the rocks at? Where the watch at? Stop that!
You can cop that? Not that, I'm relaxin on my back
Dime sack I'm catchin on contact
Got racks, y'all niggaz ain't 'bout that, 'bout that life

[Chorus]

[Meek Mill]
Poof! Nigga fuck yo' life
Fuck y'all niggaz and fuck your wife
Got two bad bitches with a nigga
and they ain't know they gonna fuck all night
And I rock hard white, miggaz wrist game pride
I pull up on the horse and I'm sitting on fours in a big boy drive
Call big boy shot, all clear stones in my big boy watch
All year long got the strip on lock
Everytime we in this bitch man shit gon' pop
My hip on glock, your hip on nothin
My niggaz got racks, y'all niggaz be frontin
Red Cartier, red bone bitch
Red nottoms on her, hair long as shit, hold up~!
Yellow gold rope, yellow bone hoe
And yellow bottoms it's paid nigga
Whole cliques of made niggaz

Typed by: Cno Evil

[Ghostface Killah]
Yeah, yo, aiyo these duffel bag niggas is lame hoes, I flame those
Your papa should of left you a stain on clothes
I rock heavy metal, eighteen karats or better
Blue steel or Beretta, I'mma stack that feta
Guacamole, my shit is fat, I call it rolly polly
Niggas is screaming like "There goes Tony, moly!"
The baddest bitches walking two steps behind me
Cuz the God's robes flaring out, shit I don't care about
One false move on the kid, I'm airing out
Dumping, pellets be hop, skipping and jumping
With the automatic shotgun, hand on the pumping
Dung-dung! Watch your whole body flop
And wild the fuck out, I'm like a bull in a China shop
Beastie, I can walk on cut glass, I bust ass
Niggas better cover they face or get slashed
Or see me and your granny in your yard, getting trashed

[Chorus 2X: Solomon Childs]
Aiyo, back out, give 'em the whole thing, black out
Squeezin' til it's spring break, nigga, black out
You run out of bullets, just swing, nigga, black out
Don't give a fuck about a thing, nigga, black out

[Lil' Fame]
I chant warrior's songs for all my warriors gone
Spilled the blood, sweat and tears, ya'll just call it a song
Yes I'm, highly explosive, yes I'm, something ferocious
Niggas fucking with my nerves like multiple sclerosis
What time, and you get your food ate, give 'em a buck and a half
Across the face, and scrape the plate
I'll lift your muthafuckin' hood up, like a mechanic
And leave you layin' for life, in your hammock, God damn it
This is marksmen

[Billy Danze]
My niggas is prone to black out
Double handed out the Chevrolet, until it maxs out
Mo P's is g's, these niggas tap out
Buck-a-buck-buck-buck-buck-buck-buck, push your back out
If you don't know what that's bout, pack up and stab out
Make a decision or deal with conditions, when I spaz out
Unload, reload, unload, reload
Hand 'em a couple more, and keep a couple for the road

[Chorus 2X]

[Pharoahe Monch]
Pull out the ratchet, this is not rap
The rap shit is liver then Superfly saliva when the Mack spit
That, raat, tip-tip-tip-tip-tip tap shit
That you cannot stick to landing like Gaby Douglas when you back flip
My hammer dance that make you niggas do the running man
Seventy seven blackout, Berkowitz, Son of Sam
Understand what you working with is word perfect
The earth surface is profilic circuit, breaker-breaker circuits
Enter your information, we blacks out
Spontaneous combustion, instantaneous identification
Pop your melon like Gallagher, you won't survive
Psychopath with a silencer, my caliber is forty five
Tumultuous tragedy, infamous, infamy
These agree the statistics, will increase exponentially
Potentially, my brain is probably twisted
This auto shotty lifted your body and dropped it like a molly kid shit

(Chorus 2x)
Experience destruction of self through greed
Still I resent every day that I breathe
True, it's on the negative that I feed
But that's how my dark soul chose to bleed

(Verse 1)
Explore philosophies based upon re-incarnated
Shaded ways of life display strive created
through the compliments belated,
Woke in the morning feeling hated by my loved ones
As I shove guns in my mouth in a dark alley in the inner city
Called the ghetto
Even dreams stated shitty 
The acidity of my saliva enjoys my flesh 
From the inside, the pain from moves from my gut to my chest
Here we rating like cancer breast from the stress level
On a quest to make money with sober fuck the devil
With this black magic forked-tongue that I amputate
With my mind, sometimes the rhymes the only way to ventilate
All the evil spirits from the inner-self
I concentrate, on flaws placed upon my inner-shelf
Observation, my, orbit, visionary
Pre-destination relief destroys what you carry, as choice
My voice reflects the dark times
The darkness, cleansed by kerosene
Now it's time for me to spark this flame
Spark this flame, spark this flame until ignition, refrain

(Chorus 2x)

(Verse 2)
Captivating my movements, my mentals move through
All the un-natural elements designed to disgroove
The harmony between, the scars on me and the
Contruction of character, I live with agony
As a re-occurant theme the motive is blood
I bleed, beneath the surface deep beneath my face I bleed 
I believe, echoes in my mind as Apostle's Creed shines
My thoughts empower me, to devour the, strong side of me
Now cowardly I cry, As I try to defy three
Of the lovers in my world
Family true Earth and this music is my girl
Damn she used to love me, hope you dub me
Onto tape numerous times, 
Then you lose generations and eventually lose mine
Non-existant, used to be positively persistant
Think about how myself forgot and now i'm jisted
Now I'm blacklisted, with flashbacks and nightmares
where i'm slash-wristed and my vertabrae is twisted
Point, I missed it, about life so take heed
To my audio-biographical sketch in which I bleed

(Chorus 2x)

That's how my dark soul chose to bleed (what, what)
That's how my dark soul chose to bleed (what, what)

yes yes, yes yes

Take that motherfucker here's a bomb on y'all
Dynamite in the heat of the night I get raw
Get the mic get creative and break the last straw
Doper than the dopest shit that you ever saw

[Chorus Pt 2]
And we breaking their laws and we're breaking their jaws
And they try their best to keep up with the mouth of the Czar
They're getting stabbed in their arm, they're getting hit by a car
They're getting stoned on relentlessly with two by fours

(Lyrics Born [& Lateef]): 
So hey Lateef [what's happening] I want to see my cousin freak it up
Like demon fuzz, making all the disbelievers give it up [and you know that]
Now with the whole world listening
You got the floor chisel it in with precision
(Lateef): Because we're meaner and we're cleaner stepping into the arena
Set the roof on fire, like a lighter and gasolin-a
Got the people hype regardless of their nation or region
What's the reason
It seems my singing is pleasing I'm still protected from treason
They keep ringing them, kind of like a guitar string
Jingling jangling with your mental I'm mangling
If you hating on the beat, or the lyrics that I'm singing
Like a four pound hot shot straight through Texas

(Lateef & [Gift of Gab]): 
Ay yo Gab (what's up) show them what you have (alright!)
I know you're itching for this microphone to grab (and you know that)
We independent like trucks with ??bolts oh??
Now flip the track, like the thing was a train and you's the Incredible Hulk

[Gift of Gab]
I'm crumbling an underling another thing a brother mumbling
I'm pummeling I'm humb-ely because I rhyme like Thumbelina
Hovering above covering your mouth, I'm hot like Jalepeños
The arena now is unbelievably
Wondering how the undefeated brother be uncovering
Discoveries that's undistinguished can I form my English?
Orbiting above sort of fiending for the portal
Bringing up the sulfur then be pourn out the outer reaches for you!

[Chorus pt 1]

[Lyrics Born]
Full fledged el capitan raise the flag
Pulsating cross creeping through the blades of grass
Bass bumping formation like an ancient plant
Long savers strong take it home answers lanterns
Full fleets fog ???? to conquering your camp
Palm sweet long livin armies of Babylon “E”
Plastique concrete I'll blast the party
With y'all chickens in a victory bag

[Chorus Pt 1]

[Chorus Pt 2]

Coming through the door to conk your lockjaw
You're eardrums bust from the sound of applause

Cause the Boyz N Da Gump are always hard
You comin talkin that trash we'll pull your card
Knowin nothin in life but to be legit
Don't quote me boy cause I ain't said shit yet

You got a problem with me? Then I got a problem with you
You got a couple choices of what you can do
It's not a tough decision as you can see
I can blow you away or you can ride with me
You better ride with me cause I can get you to the border
The P's after me from what I did to his daughter
I did her like this, I did her like that
I did her with the wiffleball bat, soooooooo

I ride around town, '88 Camry
No radio and my tank's on E (D-DJ Frank White!)
No AC but I got plenty heat
So you can have everything that my parents bought me
Yeah, yeah, yeah

* this song first appears on "Braggin' Writes" b/w "Hush the Crowd"
  as a vinyl twelve inch - on this comp. Premier scratches the lyrics

[J-Live]
For underground metaphors
You can scrape an inch below the turf, for what it's worth
My style's been developed in the core of the Earth
The exhale's volcanic, the inhale is seismic
So brothers just panic when he Live one arrives with
The natural ability to run through your crew
From 2-1-4 to 2-1-3 to 2-1-2
In other words, from Dallas, to L.A., to the place where J stay
Everyday is mayday
So you can talk your trash on how you're wettin MC's
with mad blood stains but I'll bet you can't stand the rain
I look upon your brain with disdain
Go back and reflect on my endeavors black I can't complain
It's like a raw deal, consistant with the way I make you feel
The ends stay revealed while the means I conceal
And those who try to steal get decapitated
You wanna snatch my H2O type flow, but it evaporated
I displays my credentials over instrumentals
And my potential, increases at a rate that's exponential
It's detremental questionin my thesis
The penetration's exact, like amniocentesis
I rip your rhyme to pieces after drainin out your fluid
My vocab is fluent yours is evident of being truant
I know you wanna make moves but son you best to take a second look
Before my knight takes your rook

Chorus:

Cause everybody's rappin, and only few can flow
So why the hell they tryin to deal with Live I don't know
I handle true MC's on their block or at their show
So if you come with bull kid, keep it on the low

[J-Live]
Cause yo, I got the hairsplittin, self-written unbitten style
that leaves the competition running scared and shakin in their pants
You best to set it off cause black it aint no second chance
once I'm open, all you doin is hopin that the Live one
will put the mic down, but son don't try to snatch it after
The laughter won't cease from the comparison, how dare you son
Step around the booth when I'm on
The microphone magician says poof, you're gone with the wind
There's no trace of your friends cause you don't know where the
beginning ends or where the end begins
But you see that's the difference, you get sold, I get paid
Black I told you, get paid
If you're broke I'll have to rain on your parade
You belong in Special Ed if you think you Got It Made
J-Live with the mic is like the chef with the blade
Cause suckers get sliced and sauteed
Yeah, you thought your joint was fly but the flight was delayed
because

Chorus: repeat 2X

[J-Live]
Cause yo, I take the grey matter of pretenders
through my mental blender, and then return to sender
My pen don't pretend to offend
I intend to render MC's, hangin loose like a fender bender
I recommend regardless of your gender
That you strike messin with J-Live from your agenda
And remember that whoever lends a helpin hand to defend ya
Will get burned to a cinder
As I end the, reign of wack MC's with their suicidal tendencies
Renderin me sick, with the thoughts of killin enemies
But then I return to reality
Metaphorically murderin MC's when they battle me
You can't rattle me
I'm not your average snake slitherin through the grass
I surpass the serpent as I head to class
You consider me crass as I wax that ass; style's no joke
but you best belive I gets the last laugh

Album:  America Is Dying Slowly A Soundtrack For Life
Song:   I Breaks 'Em Off


Verse 1:

Yeah, I run rings around your crew like a track star
So stay back far
You better understand who the macks are
A brand new invention is my intention
Been rappin so long some say I should get a pension
Ain't no tension 
If I forgot to mention
I rock rhymes over beats for salary and commission
I got it all figured out like Columbo
I'll drop you like Dumbo
Your album is weak, and so is your video
Or should I say wackeo
Your girl is a tacky hoe
Go back to slangin rocks and leave rappin to Coolio
It's the all assmatic, tongue acrobatic, loc
Used to be smoked out recovered crack addict
I'll dip you in some sauce, fool, I'm the boss
And I still be sending busters to Harris & Ross
You, gotta pay the cost I refuse to take a loss
So I spit like I feel it and dust your junky ass off

Chorus, Repeat 3X:

I break 'em off
I break 'em all off

Verse 2:

I got to keep on the real
With my hands on the steel
Cause we all understand we got to die one day
But, everybody knows we got to rise to the top
And the mission don't stop till the casket drop
I'm protected by the tech 
And the teflon vest
And we earn that respect
Cause we worked so hard so put that needle on the record
And everybody check it, cause I never been affected
By what they say
It's been a whole lot of years since I shed tears
For my fears I downed case loads of beers and drank jack with my peers
So never let it be said that I fronted a fake 
I keep the treble in my highs and lows in my bass
So feel the affect of the wine and funk
But you gotta have hustle which can vibrate you funk
City to alley to valley hood and block
You know I got the sound to break 'em off

Chorus, Repeat 7X:

I came back from the Congo as Return Of The Jedi
I smoke the spinach and you get popped in your ezzye
Watch me do this
You take a ass whoopin like Brutus
My rhymes will sound like Buddah, like Olive Oil is skinny and Whimpee
Sea Hag don't never tempt me
Get up on the funk so you can feel the simpy
I can do the rope-a-dope
And steal a base like Davey Lopes
And bring more hope back to the hood than the Pope
So, drink some Scope and try to feel sure
See, if you can endure 
The pressure that's put on your
But your soggy ass don't stay crunchy in milk
That's why your cap get peeled, yeah, you're soft as silk
It's time to seperate the real from the fake
You shaky like Jake 
And your  game always get exposed when you perpetrate
Check the Times and the Post
This is straight west coast
And when I break it off you know it's broke

Chorus, Repeat 7.5 times

This is straight west coast!

did you want the house, the dog, the white picket fence
the wife with three kids that helped your life make sense
the friends, petty trends, the mercedes benz
keep the picture on the wall but its all just pretend
I thought I had it all figured out
but time's an empty hole and it becomes filled with doubt
born a man, hopin to become the boy
lived a life, only to be destroyed
from birth to death, the baby's first steps
didn't affect the purest state that we have left
best to start slow though pressure becomes past
the innocence is lost and ignorance grows vast
it all happens so fast when you're facin to the wind
you better count the chips before its time to cash em in
cuz by then you'll realize that you've lost your drive
while workin a 9 to 5 until you turn 95
sick and tired, know why its time to quench the fire
while speakin of how you felt you can call yourself retired
the live wire is dead, left quiet as kept
It's the birth, the death, the old man's last breath

(the old man said...this is how it all began)

It's perverse, from birth to the hearse
immersed in a search tryin to quench our thirst
if I only learn one thing, its the truth hurts
it would all make sense livin life in reverse
It's perverse, from birth to the hearse
immersed in a search tryin to quench our thirst
and if I only know one thing, its the truth hurts
it would all make sense livin life in reverse

I am but a reoccuring cycle of light
bound to this physical vessel until I reach the afterlife
and I might escape as my soul is undressed
i'll fall through all the answers that I saw this time press
wait and find a different person staring in the mirror
left to pull my life together from the pieces of a stranger's dream
a vague haze of past days last breath, sun sets, same story, new day, next scene
It's just bickering energy trading places
more like repeating different names and changing faces
the soul's eternal but the body soon wasted
walk into the new light as the past is slowly faded
I'm falling from earth, return through rebirth
carry body, open wings, a freedom far from all the hurt
so when my cycle's complete, I'll return to innocence
with nothing else to guide me but the traces of my inner sense

It's perverse, from birth to the hearse
immersed in a search tryin to quench our thirst
if I only learn one thing, its the truth hurts
it would all make sense livin life in reverse
It's perverse, from birth to the hearse
immersed in a search tryin to quench our thirst
and if I only learn one thing, its the truth hurts
it would all make sense livin life in reverse

Now Clap It Up, Clap It Up Clap It Up Now
Now Clap It Up, Clap It Up Clap It Up Now
Now Clap It Up, Clap It Up Clap It Up Now
Now Clap It Up, Clap It Up Clap It Up Now

[Chorus]
Breathe In
Take it in slow, let it work up in your soul
Take ya time and let it grow before you blow
Breathe Out
Let 'em know what you about from the words in your mouth
To the way you live it out no doubt

[Verse One]
Don't rock don't pop don't drop don't move
Just listen real close to what I'm trying to tell you
Its probably something different than what your used to
So let me break it down so the truth don't miss you
I learned a little bible was ready to take off
Armed with the truth but dropped the grace off
When everybody see me they ready to break off
I said to myself "Oh well, just stay lost"
Breathe In
But wouldn't take the word in slow
Lost the context that I heard before
Wouldn't meditate on the word I just go
Forget a commentary I got to save souls
They say wisdom is better than silver and gold
But I skipped that verse and I hit the door
Man they couldn't tell me nothing
Thought that I was on to something
And I was running all directions
Just a brother trying to gun it

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
I was telling folks I know the spirit got my back
But I never picked the word up and read the facts
It was on now, I was in the zone now
Jesus had twelve well I was on my own now
People leave me alone now
Bout to get it gone now
But I fell flat upon my face I'm all alone now
Didn't have the truth in my sling
I was just trying to wing it
If it sound good I'm gonna say I'm gonna mean it
If its in the bible thats cool, I believe it
But I ain't really study so I couldn't really see it
See man you got to believe man
Now I breathe in, breathing out is so easy

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
Last verse but I got a lot more to say
Got a partner named Jay from around the way
Breathe out all day but he wouldn't breathe in
He give the seed out but he wouldn't read man
And he told me theology was for them birds
And he really didn't need it when he read the word
Look left, Look right for a sign from God
But he didn't know the word was inspired by God
Telling people bout a couple funny things he heard
But the things that he heard they ain't match the word
If they don't match the word well they ain't true
Cause the bible is the final say on the things we do
I said Jay now, I understand how you feel
Man I love your zeal but you probably want to chill
He said Crae now, you can read all day
But I'm just a little different man that ain't my way
So I told him, how the word of God was true
How Paul was a Jew who would use the truth
of the Old Testament to make things clear
Thank God that day Jay turned an ear
Now he reading, reading, and reading the word
And his life look like what he see in the word
Matter of fact he don't ever want to leave the word
I'm trying to tell y'all that boy breathe the word!

[Chorus]


Now check this out y'all
I want y'all to keep it holy man
I know this beat sounds like one of them beats
That make you want to do something
You ain't got no business doing
You know what I'm saying, check it out
But lets try something a little different
Let me see

Do the once was blind but now I see
Do the once was blind but now I see
Do the once was blind but now I see
Do the once was blind but now I see

Do the hot, hot, hot, hot in the church
Do the hot, hot, hot, hot in the church
Do the hot, hot, hot, hot in the church
Do the hot, hot, hot, hot in the church

Now Clap it up, Clap it up, Clap it up now
Now Clap it up, Clap it up, Clap it up now
Now Clap it up, Clap it up, Clap it up now
Now Clap it up, Clap it up, Clap it up now

Replace it with mean green, roll it up and take a hit
And you bitch-made fools
Homey, there's no excuse
So stay down, so stay one
You learn from your roots
From the steel toe boots
Hush Puppies and Chuck Taylors
Smugglin' pounds of shit across the border, can't nobody tell us
A damn thang, we bang, slang and clang
Huh

Hey, hey

Who got the shit that'll make your motherfuckin' brain bleed?

Got some bomb weed, now the situation sticky
Hit me on the cellphone

Lettin' the chain swing in the wind when I'm grimin'

Typed by: Cno Evil

[Intro: RZA]
When you forge a weapon, you need three things
The right metal, temperature's over 1400 degrees
And someone who wants to kill
Here in Jungle Village, we got all three

[Intro: Method Man]
Yo, Street, check me out, nigga

[Method Man]
Sorta like Malcolm at the Audubon, they coming for me
My time is money, no automa', see bar for bar
I keep it pushing, no R&R, no foreign broads
And no promotion for foreign car, the game is ours
Let's keep it funky, who said he washed?
Like Staten Island, Italians bleed spaghetti sauce
If ya'll shaking with Stallion, then ya'll already lost
Already crossed, then like Christ, I'm ready for 'em
Plus anybody that say he know 'em, I'm taking numbers
I'm taking names, I'll take ya chain, to take his hunger
Pain, pain, pain, pain, pain, pain
Can you feel the thunder and rain?
I don't talk it like the rent, boy, I got it done in the game, ya'll
Do me a favor, don't ever play with my ball
Never been a playa hater, I just ain't playing with ya'll
You watch your lane, but look I'm taking the charge
Going hard'll get you two shots, now I'm facing the charge

[Chorus 2X: Freddie Gibbs]
Uh, five to life, let's go take a ride
They might catch you by surprise, if you let 'em slide
But if you built for the shit, then you might survive
Guess I"ll see you, when you wake up on that other side

[Freddie Gibbs]
Uh, sorta like Mike at the United Center
Madison Square, Boston Garden, I straight ignite on niggas
Little nigga, your raps ain't on fire, that shit'll collapse so don't try
I scribble and scratch down in my pad, and no lie
That no fake, that uncut, that straight drop, what the fuck
I'm pulled over by the jakes and 28 up in my nuts
For I'm took away and cuz I'd rather lay up in the duct'
Feel like fuck a friend, a hundred million haters ain't enough
Twist it up, life is a blunt and the world is my ash tray
I got them quarters and them hash, just meet me like half way
I need a hundred percent of my profit, ain't fucking with half pay
Ain't taking no shorts or losses, bitch, we ain't funding no tag day, for sure
As I can recollect, praying to God, this dope'll stretch
Turn mobster corners, work these corners like behind it, yes
Chilling and waiting patient, retaliation just ain't find me yet
I'm taking in to heaven, you couldn't buy me that, remind me that

[Chorus 2X]

[Streetlife]
It's the world's worse, quick to snatch your man purse
And leave your body head first in the stretch hearse
Murder she wrote, I'm knock to spit a killer verse
And leave a plate of blood spillin' on his dinner shirt
You, can Google my name but you ain't gotta search
I'm right here in the streets, I'm putting in work
Go 'head, fuck around and get your feelings hurt
Or, you can get carried out of your local church
I'm from the old school, I do my own dirt
Mama raised no fool, I did my home work
Keep your wifey close, she's a little flirt
I knew her since '03, I hit the pussy first
I'm the reason why your baby mama water burst
I been mobbing since birth, you can ask my Earth
It's not a problem, to show you how the shotty work
I put your body in the dirt, but what the dollars worth

[Chorus 2X]

I'm built for it, nigga

Hot tubs and yacht clubs is how we play
Even on the field it's allowed to fear
Just call me Mike Tys' cuz I got your ear

So yo, show me the money, type Gerry McGuire
Me and Mrs. Brown the way it has to be
Is there heaven for a balla'? Ask Master P
It's a season for changes, reason for dangers
Nintendo 64's and four point six ranges
Triple beams away I cripple teams for pay
Me say it's for the sign on the Cartier
It's matching cars and super bowl rings
Cuz real playa's do real things

[Foxy]
Real nigga's do real things
Nana got her eyes on you
See that's how I plays
Kinda feeling baby boy since his Green Bay days
Huh? Believe that, ain't no deceiving that
Definitely tryin' to see that

Uh-Huh? Lemme flash that mac, it's phat
In fact, we can make it happen with my double platinum
Stay stashin' in the twin five matchin'

Get up in your stacks and take a little (*edited*)

You won't catch me without a dime
And so whatchu want, Cristal, Dom P, or Mo'
You call the play, we could do it on the creep
Don't let me find out that your girl's a freak
She can come see me if the dough is right
And front the eighty inch on a Monday night
In the back of the Benz, Six Coupe, drop top
All up in her (*edited*) cuz the Chiefs don't stop
Y'all cats ain't know it's all 'bout the game

Listen dude, Tip can use any tool known to man (ay, ay, ay)
And don't think that I can't hit you just cause it ain't in my hand (say what?)
Got a sniper, drop your ass where you stand, understand? (Bow)
Fifty cal with a scope and a chopper (hey), boy you got to 
Plan a way straight to the undertaker, know me for the doctor (AY)
Should I die, lay me next to my daughter Lelah and my partner (what it is)

Pretty Tone, I got you.. Fingers

[Inspectah Deck]
Morphine flow, lean on the brass gold
I can see your snake eyes without the crap roll
Bust the mack stroll, laughing at you assholes
Sticking thorns in my pride like the Black Crowes
Cracking your dome for breakfast, Deck spit
Lava, fresh like the product section
Repping, there's no use testing, you know who stepped in
It's Deck, bitch, for those who question
Like Serena on the swerve, I swing hard
Main event, bad broads with ring card
This shit here, niggas get the fiend nod
On the wreck, though, these cowards never seen yard
Head boss, you scavenge off what Deck toss
I don't fall for petty talk I check the source
Flex force with army arms, I lets off
Bomb threat, blow both your stanky legs off

[Sheek Louch]
Pay attention, gun shots, fuck what you benching
Big chains on my neck, my wrist is Clinton
Presidential Rolex, coming out the projects
Seat back looking mean in a foreign object
Three for twenty in Japan, with American money
Get back home, get head from American bunnies
My Iron Fists, my platinum wrists
My cook up game is chemists, fuck my nemesis
Fly birds like Tyson do, had to switch
From the car to the cargo on board Jet Blue
Bodies drop from the Liquid Swords, been making hits for years
But I'm mad I ain't got no awards
I'm a real OG tho, swag like James Bond and 'em
My white tee is my tuxedo
Belts on the track, Sheek and Ghostface
Got the hood on smash, RZA leave it like that

[Chorus]

[Ghostface Killah]
We be jammin', I grill on the track just like salmon
I don't play no games, baccarat or backgammon
I'm Supreme Cliente', rawer than sushi
And if your girl got my number, means I beat that pussy
Sword slayer, dick slinger, I got the stroll
Of an R&B singer, Wu-Tang ruckus bringer
36 different dialects, we call spot checks
My homeland security, is up in the projects
Shaolin, Stapleton, Bricks on Broad Street
That's where niggas get chopped up like raw meat
Fuck that, started off rocking a stocking
Over my face, now my face is what gets it popping
Donnie had the wave voice, beeing blowed through the mic
The definition of true TV, fuck Spike
I'm the realest Akeed that ever wet these blocks
Too black for BET, two wild for Cops

Youknow'mtalkinbout and I got my shit right here with me {By my side}

(Okay) So being that that's the case {By my side}
Let me tell you about {By my side}
That place, heh, take you by my side {By my side}

[Stat Quo]
The way I growed up, sho' nuff, chips on my shoulder
Knew about that cola when I was in a stroller
But came ahold of choppin them boulders gettin older
Wantin a Rover, ducked in them rows meetin quotas
Shorty bipolar, load her by cock I tried to told ya
When movin the wrong direction ain't no flesh and then it's over
You on that doja, G.I. Joe shit but you ain't a soldier
Chopper or fold ya, you not cobra commander, you bozo
I'm the composer, writer of murder, the odor
leakin out of your body, temperature is gettin colder
But you sweatin and dizzy like a person who ain't sober
Realizin your life is comin quickly to a closure
Losin composure, out of breath like you underwater
Twenty seconds in the game, and it's the fourth quarter
Primetime, "Dateline" are the best exposure
Now you're still, on the news and everybody knows ya
Yeahhhh, YEA!

[Chorus]
By, my, side
To all the niggaz tryin to get me it's – by my side
I'm takin some of y'all with me it's – by my side
I'm makin sure they won't forget me it's – by my side
To all the niggaz tryin to get me it's – by my side
I'm takin some of y'all with me it's – by my side
I'm makin sure they don't forget me it's – by my side
Ye-yeah ye-yeah ye-yeahhhh; by my side (ooh)

[Stat Quo]
Go now boy, get your vest, protect yo' neck, kill for fun
Watch how they run and scatter when I go and pull out my gun (gun)
Call me ignorant and young, psycho sicko negro
They know that I just fuck and be gone (gone)
Drivin crazy halfway dumb
Don't stop even when the law come, believe every word out my lungs
I'm losin it, snappin huh, this ain't just no rappin uh
Back all the way back when you see that strap cause it go dada-da-da
Are you ready to die tell me why you choose to tell me in my
face, have your body dry, pack that fire, look in my eye
Have your spirit below me or floatin in the fuckin sky
All black is my attire, lookin like a umpire
Toss you in the trash like a bullshit, out fly
Yeah yeah ye-yeah ye-yeahhhh, YEA!

[Chorus]

[Stat Quo]
The murder capital mo' mayhem, yes it's thriller
Put four in your head, have you floatin off in a river
It's cold, you shook, we crooks, your body'll quiver
These rappers so tough but really they softer than pillows
Or chinchilla or Twinkie filler, hone of a realer
They turn to serial assassins for some scrilla
Now me could see I mean him, yes this nigga
Stays true to what I do cause I keeps it realer
Be for real, have you ever ever pulled a trigger?
It's serious business shorty, nothin is more iller
No discrimination, you could be chocolate or vanilla
And find yourself in the presence of a fuckin killer
Oh, oh, oh, oh yeahhhh, YEA!

Verse 1: VK
Release the funkiness out of that chain

Let's see who got the mack with the irreputable indisputable brain, 
well unquestionably it's VK
Holler Mayday, I'm comin' out to play, la la na na
yo, years wit' papi cause I knew what I could do
It's that, take the microphone and hold my own
against any crew cuz, All I live to do is this
Flex my plex and release cres and layed back with the sticky buddhists
Partna it don't even make no sense to be percise
Atomic lyrics hittin' ya boots makin' your fingaz drop the mic
Handle your buisness, 
who's da first eye to eye witness or view the pain on the brain 
And plus get put on my shit list
I'm takin' bolders, slashin' 'em
Don't forget about your wrists, I'm takin 'em pullin you

On the side that'll snatch a snitch, Catch yo Bitch
Wrap a kix, Then smack yo rick

Hook: (2 times)

Verse 3: VK
Why try, I came to get a glimpse of yo whole clan off
But for yo rapidness, so woman to man, it stands off
I want the cultural girl for you but the zhory stacks ran off
Ima make the world see what I already saw
Me gaze switchin' the gang now I be a legit baller
We could go straight up or we could switch it to sesaw
I spray gats, so no love, with the power to sure improve
You pray for my destruction, I execute the plan that you used
I don't care who you send, no one is equivelent
I took your shit now you look annerexic on thin thin

I live for the rush, I love to thug
Niggas out for they double up, scuff 'em up
I'm stocky, rock Armani
Fleeces with the beefs and broccolis
Catch me at the lobby, dice game schemin'
Come with a demon and leave with five g's even
Even, blingin in the court room
In my beige, bubble goose snorkel
I'll extort you, in the pens
For your Kool G hat, and your blue Timbs
When I bid, I'm on it
Have your man singing love songs standing on top of the toilet

Hook 2x

La-ke, the K-I-D
Had the head detective Connely, following me
Black Gossi of Queens, nobody snitchin
Chillin in the cut, Crush Linen
Goodfella in it, drug sellin and shit
Caught a ??? on the fence, now they smellin my piss
But I Chardonay it, Kavosia it
Chop nice size point nine dimes and weigh 'em
Digitally, I literally
Changed the history of QB when I was eighteen
Now I lean in a cream BM
Listening to beats, sippin premium gin
Mobb style I don't smile in flicks
I pose whole and cocaine and four-fifths
Today the soldiers, stuck in trojans
On the V-I floors, my condolences

Hook 2x

P-S-O-P, stress and greed
Sling packs in the grass as I run from D's
Chicks stratch my B with housing keys
I allow you to eat cuz ya feeding me
I empower the streets with Machevellism
I don't care what I tell none of these niggas
My tolerance, is like Solomon's
After seven years of locking out and locking in
Liver, fishshale, piss Cristal
And only shit hallal food and fish out
Avoid crowded places, out of town faces
Cops, and being in spots where I caught cases
My fortay, is chopping up yay
And stickin niggas for thick platinum big chains
I'm like Bugsy and Bumpy

Mass distortion the amps are screaming
Pandemonium in the B-Boy Kingdom
Destroy and sting 'em venemous sharp tip
Feeling his pen strokes
For women and men folk
Ab's recording for bastard orphans
All homes is broken life's in your hands
Don't let the moment stifle your plans
God bless the homeless no one supports them
Puffin' Alaskan or maybe some Oregon
Feel the wrath of Scorpion to your misfortune
Set the torches, my last one scorched 'em
Now they back for more of this natural order
'Stract is sort of addictive on ya
Strong as a prescription for some pure ganja
Code of Honor and secret holdin'
From the oldest shamen to youngest, quote it in

(chorus)
Warriors, come out to play-ee-ay-ee-ay (Where my warriors at? Where my warriors at?)
With swords and shields and guns and knives
With pens and pads turntables mics we're
Warriors, come out to play-ee-ay-ee-ay (Where my warriors at? Where my warriors at?)
With chains and bats brass knuckles pipes
With rhymes I write that can shed some light on this

Mass confusion the spotlight beaming
Trip like illusions in colliseums
My contribution will fry their braincells
Blaze a tight rhyme now it's time to raise hell
We come with the bomb and best cuts
And when the show's over your hair is messed up like
Mass distortion grabbin' the porcelain
Drunk too much gin throw it back up nauseous
Cautious, do not drink too much nightly don't know
When my last day here might be
Rights of passage, life's a math test
Add up your successes and losses clashes
With arch-rivals, we tribal
My whole discography's a Bible
Don't bite your idols
Won't play high-post
But when I sleep it's only one eye closed, niggas

Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Fellas if you clever, trust a lady never
Have you thinkin' back and wishin' that you never met her
See her in that fitted dress and you know it's designer
She fill it out nice, but the devil wears Prada
So no, no, no, I will never ever trust her mayne
Get out my way chick cause' I already know the game
If you tryna' talk to me, I'm on my college football
In other words, I'mma act like I don't Norte Dame
Cause you been known to play the field like Norte Dame
I hate ya' face, hate ya' style, just to make it plain
Back then they told me Trix are for kids
And you been layin' on your back tricks told me ever since
Ha, I thought I had it all made
'Til you left me on my own, like Lebron did Wade
I ain't trippin' off these broads, man I'm goin' get paid
They goin' learn in a minute cause they all gettin' slayed

I don't trust 'em
Man these broads ain't about nothin'
Don't call me, no text, no discussion
They all phony and that's why I don't trust 'em
They all phony and that's why I don't trust 'em
Stand too long, getcha' seat tookin'
Stab you right in the back, soon as you ain't lookin'
They all phony and that's why I don't trust 'em
I don't, I don't trust 'em
I don't, I don't, I don't trust 'em, no

If I drowned I believe you will leave me there floatin'
I wouldn't trust you to throw a rock in the ocean
Speakin' of water, you fluid with the foolishness
Just like H2O, without the 2 in it
Damn these women all about the drama these days
[?] hard to even trust your mama these days
Gotta watch my back, might get jacked
Make the wrong move, I just might get capped
Bump that, I'm on a killin' spree
I gotta keep the flow tight
I never heard of [?] in my whole life
I guess that's just the meaning that we all know about
You brought me in this world and you take me right out
Right, right
Wicked witch of the land
Middle finger to a chick whoever sabotage a man
Cause ya'll goin' learn today, ya'll goin learn today
Go to hell with gasoline and you burn right away, ow

I don't trust 'em
Man these broads ain't about nothin'
Don't call me, no text, no discussion
They all phony and that's why I don't trust 'em
They all phony and that's why I don't trust 'em
Stand too long, getcha' seat tookin'
Stab you right in the back, soon as you ain't lookin'
They all phony and that's why I don't trust 'em
I don't, I don't trust 'em

Album:  Giant Single: The Profile Records Rap Anthology
Song:   I Can't Wait (To Rock the Mike)
Typed by: jostmatt at bluewin dot ch

To let everybody know what I got in store
It's Spyder-D in the place with the rhymes galore
To make the fly girls scream and the whole crowd break
To the bass in the place I can't wait
Cause when I'm on the mike the sucker MC's tremble
Like Jack be quick on the mike I'm nimble
So go tell your mother, your doctor or your lawyer
There's an MC in the world who's a cold destroyer
He spells his name S-p-y and d
e-r dash, then you add another D
And if you break it all down there'll be no debatin
The jam has begun, wallflowers start flakin
And with these words I do command
My smooth rap voice says it's time to dance
There's no need to procrastinate
I got more to say and I just can't wait
Huh
To rock the mike

(Fresh)

I just can't wait
To rock the mike

(Drop that funky)
(Drop that)
(Drop that funky bass)

I said 1-2
1-2-3
Hit it

When I await on a party day
The time just moves so slow
Cause I can't wait till night time come
So I can start my show
Rrrha

When I get to the jam the house is packed
The crowd will say, 'Spyder, we're glad you're back'
I say, 'Yes I'm back, so let's all get right
MC's in the place, surrender the mic'
Then they roll out a carpet that leads to the stage
I am AJ-ed down, burgundy and beige
Nikes on my feet, cold bass in effect
Cut to make everybody break in a sweat
So with these words, heed my command
My smooth rap voice says it's time to dance
No need to procrastinate
I got more to say and I just can't wait
Huh
To rock the mike
Till the broad daylight
To rock the mike
(Fresh)
I can't wait

(Cause when the Spyder's on the beat)
(Cause when the Spyder's on the beat)
(When the record goes round and the DJ backspins)
(DJ Doc)
(Just start that funky rhythm again)

(Rock)
(Rap)

Now this tempo is slow and it's time to go
Cause Spyder-D is doin his show
And when I'm on the mic, you see I don't bite
Recite what other sucker MC's write
Don't imitate the D, all ya duck MC's
Cause compared to the Spyder you're a bunch of fleas
I can't wait to rock the mike
Hah, to the broad daylight

She can't wait to cash that check but I got to rock the mike
He can't wait to meet that girl but I got to rock the mike
You know they can't wait to graduate but I got to rock the mike
I can't wait to rock the mike, you know I just can't wait
Ha

Album:  The 41st Side compilation
Song:   Cardboard Box
Typed by: Sensaye@webtv.net

Verse 1: (Havoc)

41st side nigga, them thirsty side niggas
number one pick, gutter litter, leavin' 'em bitter
how the fuck a nigga figure he can come through this?
with no worry at all and ice on his wrist
plottin' to get it, poppn' them slugs
one in the mug, leave 'em in the morgue, keepin' it gangsta? we keepin'
it thug 
makin' albums, washin' that dough made from narcotics
you know the mob brolic, gats we got it 
like a bitch on her period, don't even wanna see you 
unless you got what I need, and we sure not peoples
only niggas that I fuck wit' could hold what I bust wit'
a one minute nigga, hit 'em like when I nut quick
got a bad ass bitch that'll fuck your clique 
ass so fat, make the illest nigga dry snitch 
it's time to stretch on these cats 'cause my dogs is restless
the number one sinner mothafucka, repent this.

Chorus - 

Fuckin' wit' us will leave you in a cardboard box
fuckin' wit' us will leave you leakin', callin' the cops
with nothin' to bust? we'll leave you in a fucked up spot
and you don't even wanna be that nigga claimin' a spot. 
(repeat)

Verse 2: (The Jackal)

Play stupid, 32 shots nigga, looped it 
64 troopers, Tim boots and Rugers
show and prover, Q.B. manuever
pure breed grower, flow gives brain tumors
holla at ya dog, movin' units 
ain't ready for the onslaught
try to knock the Don off
not too much talk, niggas just pop off 
got that feelin' inside, who willin' to ride?
aight here, take this Four-Five
cardboard box these niggas off sides
rap nigga live, rap niggas alive
that nigga high, gangsta stroll, stackin' to the sky 
poppin' his collar nigga, tossin' that dollar
act up, blood clot his throat, make it hard to swallow
used to pitch times holdin' trotters
now I pitch 16's with the culture power saga
you sorry, don't bother, Q.B. to Carter
Rucker, Nino, Goodfella, Godfather. 

Chorus x2 

Verse 3: (Littles)

Came home after 5, stood on my own two 
I learned to seperate Men from Boys and crews
I toy with dudes, now I'm just annoyed with fools
I'm a pimp on a track with another Mans food 
I refuse to be whored by another Mans rules
It's a pimp and ho game, you gotta respect the business 
but I only mob with thugs and gangsta niggas 
it seems nowadays snitches get respect 
ya'll don't know a real nigga 'till he's layed to rest?
ya'll lucky I ain't come home chasin' necks 
arms, legs, chests, blazin' tecks 
'cause I love to snap, crackle, and pop them hammers
rock bandanas, cop wanna knock and jam us
watch and slam us, locked up, box and canners
'cause when I start lickin' all you niggas start snitchin'
bitchin', little niggas start missin'
we provide ya'll with the truth and facts 
ya'll don't wanna give me burn with these ruthless raps
shit, I'll bounce ya'll ass straight off the tracks
plus I roll with gorillas and I'm true to cats. 

Chorus x2

Verse 4: (Nature)

All I need is a kick and a snare, ya'll niggas scared
my name speaks for itself, it rains as soon as it hits the air 
got a wicked stare, one eye crossed 
in Queens fiends returnin' every gun I toss 
every dun I corpse, my religion is none
I figured once I lay it out niggas 'll run 
I could type it up e-mail 
and give it to you, when you're done you're comin' back for a refill
grade A shit, like the taste of the haze and the dro
I rock the same Guess jeans five days in a row
see my Thirty-Six waist is now Thirty-Eight 
quick to help a nigga up to the pearly gates 
makin' sure every other live nigga heard of Nate
guaranteed to boost the murder rate 
if it don't it will niggas, chill just give it some time
how much pain can a nigga provide?
ya'll niggas rhyme?

Spend a lot of time in Hampt-i-ons, do a lot of beats you can't be on
Damn all these fans can't be wrong, damn B.I.G. you can't be gone
Make those beats thugs want to rock, make a nigga feal just like 'Pac
Make it street but it just might pop, make it straight to the mountain top
Had the Chi' on lock, when they finally heard our sound with Roc
Came in the game, changed it again, changed everything, yeahhhhh
If you feelin this here, throw your fuckin hands in the air

[Chorus]

[Young Chris - over Chorus]
Its the Roc-a-Fella label baby fuck them other labels baby
And we been duckin shots from all them haters lately

Leave us the fuck alone, let us roc!
We are Roc-Heusen, we're the R., O., C. - HOLLA!

[Cam'Ron]
I'm here Dame, I'm here, Killa
This is just fate, how I would sit on a crate
Listen to tapes everyday a frisk was at stake
Chicks cuffs risk gettin raped my mission was straight thug
Visit them states near them great Michigan lakes
And fuck a bathroom, I pissed on the gate
Flipped a bird outta flip a bird switch up my plates
I got plans that was better than jail
Now look we like Bird, Parish, Kevin McHale
Scott, Worthy, Jabbar, and Magic
Oh my god it's Magic, Isiah, Dumars, I will carve your casket
Feel Scotty and Mike, feel Shaq and Kobe
My gats will de-tatch you homie
And I'm friends with thugs, I sell endless drugs
For the Roc Fam dog I extend my love
Jay, Bleek, beef I'll be crossin the bridge
Tossin they wigs make corpse of they kids
Free, O, Sparks and Mack Mittens
I'm 95 south, no doubt, mac clip in
I stack chips and, I'm Sacs Fifth-in
Louis Vuitton loughers, hat drippin
I go retrieve a duck, tell her proceed and suck
I don't just beat my cases, I beat 'em up
My lawyer eat 'em up put bars behind me
I'm glad they didn't stop that car behind me
Shit, it had three felons, gun shooters no
50 cal. A.C.P. Bazooka Joe
Don't be stupid though, I get scrilla man
I'm for'rilla man, yeah it's killa Cam
Uhhh... DICK SUCK BITCH!

[Chorus] - overlaps the end of Cam's verse

[Dame Dash]
What y'all thought I was finished?
I'm not!  I just recuited somebody new!
I'm like the George Steinbrenner of this shit
I mean I'm rich like him, HOLLA!

[Twista]
Everybodys swarmin oh my god
It's the newest power forward of the squad
A legacy like Jordan with the mob
that be known for breakin motherfuckers hard
Put Roc-A-Fella on my pinky ring
Fuck a battle nigga I'ma get them thangs
Rollin with them Lords and them folks up out the Chi
Twista gone make em spit the game
I represent the mob to the fullest
You don't want it with that boy who's known to pull it
With Kanye on the track of the Dream Team
I'm fin' to be the shit no matter which way you put it
They blessed a nigga in, now I'm fin' to go into a zone
Takin it to some motherfuckers domes
Cause it's on, I will rock until I'm gone
Fillin my body with lead, clutchin chrome
Take it to your gut, take it to your chest
I be more provokin when I'm smokin sess
And we gettin stronger hope you got a vest
Already got them macs, already got them techs
Served a few dimes, Beans got pearls
Legendary we on top of the world
How could you haters think we can be done
Hold it down because we got champions!!

Song:   Change
Typed By: jehender@umich.edu

At the end of 1974, when daddy dukes went raw
The chosen sperm to explore and reach the egg for sure
A child through the birth canal on the nine mo' trial
Released on this wild earth, my generation hit worst
Will my development arrested by the government
Younga niggas strugglin', livin' life got me wonderin'
New shit I'm discoverin', yo son I can't sleep
Situation so deep, my niggas drownin' in the streets
Another rapist'll stalk, a younger murder is walked
They got shit locked in a fort, a buck fif' if you're tossed
Verbalizin' hard times, findin' ways to recline
Dedicated to the rhyme brought your shades and your wine
I survived hard times prime time, as I rewind
My thoughts and remmeniss, sippin' O.E. quarts
Rest in peace to my peeps who died up in the streets
Fuck Halloween treats cause ain't shit sweet

Chorus:
Change, my life has changed 
Change, (change) and I will never be the same
Change, my life has changed
Change, (change) and I will never be the same

Growin' up on the Brooklyn streets
It was hard for Black T to make these motherfuckin ends meet
The first store that closed up got stuck
and if you didn't gimme your cash
I'd put one in somebody's gut
I ran buckwild through these streets with this group of individuals
Commiting crimes well performed like a ritual
Until one day my momz tried to send me up-state to job core
I didn't know what the fuck for
So I, pulled out my pals
And called up the nigga Al
What's the deal son it's been a fuckin' long while
He said yo Black T, I had this dream about this cream
I'm going all out for mines by any fuckin' means
We grabbed our pen and pads
And wrote about this world gone mad
And how times was getting real bad
But what we need to do
Is connect with them other two
And make that dream you had come true

I'm out the front door
Don't wanna deal with this bullshit no more
What for? I'm ready to throw this heart on the floor
Back in the days, yo, Ty had it all
Women on call, sex and all
Summer, winter, spring, and the fall  
Then my momz broke out to get away from men why no doubt
Then I settled down and made one girl a spouce
Should of known, couldn't replace momz
My heart rang the alarm, situation was da bomb
I roamed the streets, started smokin weed
Drinkin Heinie's tappin' hinies
Writin' words to rich beats
Became an everyday stuggler
Stereotyped a hustler
Constant bother
Resided with my father frequently talked with my mother
Reactions crazy, revenge thoughts, maybe
Asking what am I doin here
Someone come save me 
Cause I feel I got no purpose
*?Dabilatino?* surface
There's different type moves
With an attitude that's nervous
And nothing can help me maintain my mind frame
Now I'm doing shit I never did before

Change, my life has changed
Change, (change) and I will never be the same
Change, the world has changed
Change, (change) and it will never be the same

Brought up on green and patch
You'll never have no ash
and everyday I find myself in the same old fashion
Saddened, my same fuckin' Pumas and Lees
Tore up at the knees
That would always squeeze
My buns, I have no funds
I'm young and dumb
Left school at three o' clock
To face an eviction
In tears as it appears my crib for years
Has just been rented to the landlord kids
No rhythm, cause my rep grows rather rash
Surpassed thrid class quick to stash, when the photo flash
In contrast, I was labled as an outcast
Afraid to tell the cast
Cause chicks can tell me kiss they ass
Low self esteem but mom dukes kept me clean
Swayed from Spalding, Paydays and madman drinks
Shantlell my princess, she will live to be a queen
And as the moonbeam
Me and my team we'll be countin cream

Change, my life has changed 
Change, (change) and I will never be the same
Change, the world has changed
Change, (change) and it will never be the same
Change, you should make a change
Change, (change) and you must never be the same
Change, Evil Dee has changed
Change, (change) and he will never be the same
Change, Beatminerz change
Change, (change) and it will never be the same
Change, yes the world has changed
Change, (change) and it will never be the same

[E.Tualo]  Rob Report
[R.Report] with GZA
[E.Tualo]  and Esera Tualo
[R.Report] Yeah, yeah, Genius...
[singer]   Dreams... chase your dreams
[R.Report] Diamond Willie, Mega Raw
[E. Tualo] Back to reality
           Genius, one time, yo

[GZA]
Yo, in these dark streets, life is never complete
Lords escape from those who strictly Play IV Keeps
Neighborhood; poverty stricten
Spin and Tell like Charles Dickens
The witnesses are sickening
I seen some aquitted with the wildest crime commited
While my brother faced life and never did it
Even in High Tide, they throwing brothers off the boat
In the streets, without a vest, it's hard to stay a-float
She wrote a note, before she *sliced her throat*
Couldn't live without her son, who was killed for his coat
I closely examined, physical branden
Witnessed myself standing in a land struck with famine
Multiple homocides from atomic wars
The aftermath, poison in lakes and reseviors
Thoughts spin, I narrowly escaped Hell's Gate
But only in the physical state

Chorus: singer

I knew a girl who wanted to live The Fast Life
(You're living too fast, baby)
Now the pain cuts like a knife
(You're living trife)
Chasing her dreams instead of reality
She lost her way
And nowhere can save her from the danger
Until she finds her way in Heaven

[Rob Report]
GZA, I got a similar story to tell
'bout the teenage adolescence of this kid named Will
An ex-coroner played the {*censored*}
{*censored*}
Young black and hispanic kids be stressed over
React against the world with rude behavior
In this present year
My search for hunger and ambition is crystal clear
While my young brothers seem to chase dreams
I be gunning down my wildest fantasies

[Esera Tualo]
I be escaping fiends, making cream
Ill kids tried to stick me for the green
Seen things that'll make your head spin
Instead *fuckin* stairways to Heaven make my eyes sparkly like a gem
Where your heart has been? Confiscated by the dark
[R.Report] shorty use a *gun* and spark
Now we's in the street with the heat taking life apart
Seventeen years old, drama unfolds
Missing You like Puffy and Sting, now let them names ring

Chorus {2X}

[Esera Tualo & Rob Report]
Chasing dreams for the cash and cream
It seems some of us are fiends
for them luxery things, supreme sting
Losing lives while we out for the green
Stairs to Heaven shine like they diamond rings

[singer]
Chase your dreams, don't get lost in reality
'Cause your dreams will be your savior
and take you all the way to Heaven

Chorus

Now come and beat the realness 
Fuckin' these funky hoes will make you feel this 
Drippin' sensation stickin' your ace in the wrong place 
And you'll be ass out dickless, passin' out when you get this 
AIDS shit in your grave, ditch will be dug with a quickness 
So this is the phase of the days when I grew up 
Reminiscin' and trippin' off all them hoes I done fucked 
But it's all good and plenty 
I hust can't count how many trampy hoes I done did it to 
Licked it, did it, split it too 
But shit is cool makin' the thrilla of Manilla 
Scoop up the scrilla boy that cuchi be a killa 
You can feel a order up with a nut and then bounce 
And have that ass comin' up shorter than a fuckin' quarter ounce... 

[Gangsta P] 
Let's get toe down off some X-O, puffin' on the cripto 
Bent corner eyers up on her, super band low down dirty shame 
No need to know your age, bitch, what's your name? 
Said her name was Tammy, lived with her granny 
All I'm thinkin' about is gettin' in her panties 
Got the digits, called her later on that night 
At a two dome sex, flossin' big elex 
Cocked the roof back, bitch, blaze the sack 
Reached the destination, no hesitation 
Out of my clothes in the guts about to nut 
No protection, after two hours hopped out the shower 
Dressed in Eddie Bauer, livin' like a true playas should 
Six years later: test positive cause the hoe was no good... 

If you wanna get your groove on, come and do a little somethin' with 
me... 
If you wanna get your groove on, let's wrap it up before we fuck... 
If you wanna get your groove on, come and do a little somethin' with 
me... 
If you wanna get your groove on, let's wrap it up before we fuck... 

[Celly Cel] 
A-I-D crooked letter 
Mothafuckas better strap up when they come together 
It's a top notch so you ain't thinkin' 
Got your battlefields sinkin', caught late night full of weed, drinkin' 
Got ya creepin' in the unknown 
Steered you wrong even if you get your head blown 
Fool, you still gone, switch up your tactics: fuck with prophalactics 
It ain't about that raw dickin' her and nuttin' on the mattress 
You didn't know these hoes will put the tags on your toes 
Don't knows crossin' up the game because she chose 
Listen to your homie Celly, nigga, before you hit the telly, nigga 
Have a box of rubbers ready, nigga... 

[Almon D of 187-Fac] 
I can't lie, this whole AIDS situation got my brain drownin' in 
illusions 
Settin' niggas up for the conclusions 
I ain't sayin' that I'm gonna live forever 
Gotsta fuck new, get sometime in the future 
Don't got no babies, what about the day when you get married 
I hope I'm layin' in bed with a virgin with a meal that's urgent 
She heard that I was livin' my lifestyle lavishly 
Flashbacks of fuckin' her cousin in the alley 
Smokin' on the twamp sack that she bought the jimmy hats 
Three O'clock in the morning, sideways I was cuttin' the Pontiac 
strapped... 

If you wanna get your groove on, come and do a little somethin' with 
me... 
If you wanna get your groove on, let's wrap it up before we fuck... 
If you wanna get your groove on, come and do a little somethin' with 
me... 
If you wanna get your groove on, let's wrap it up before we fuck... 

[Den-Fenn of 187-Fac] 
Well, here's a serious situation that we facin' 
It starts off by doin' the nasty without patience 
Forgettin' about the condom 
Usin' and abusin' the drugs and methinfedamies 
She wanted to suck my dick head so bad she was beggin' me 
So I stepped to this straight bitch named Sally, Sally 
Threw my slugs at a scallywag at a club in the valley 
Leather trench, all hair down to her shoulders and back 
Some Guess jeans all deep down and her pussy read fat 
To be exact one of my niggas pulled my coat tail 
And told me that the bitch was hectic: A-I to the D-S infected... 

[G-Nut of 187-Fac] 
Mothafuckas be runnin' up in this bitch without no prophalactics 
Filthy tactics, may as well pull the strap to your head and blast it 
Suicidal decisions, livin' your life on the edge slippin' 
With one foot off in the grave and the other one on a banana peelin' 
But I ain't trippin', red ribbons in my chest 
No chemotherapy treatments needed 
Cause I'm a make it strecth to my 
Stapped all over my dick and when I digs I blow they mind back 
And then I grab my shit 

If you wanna get your groove on, come and do a little somethin' with 
me... 
If you wanna get your groove on, let's wrap it up before we fuck... 
If you wanna get your groove on, come and do a little somethin' with 
me... 
If you wanna get your groove on, let's wrap it up before we fuck... 

[Spice 1] 
Some of you niggas can't even say condoms 
Some niggas be talkin' about conderves or condos 
Straight raw dickin' hoes 
You don't know that hoe, man, that bitch can't be trusted 
Better be strapped with about four condoms 
If you plan to keep your life, soldier 
You're gonna be feelin' kinda fucked up and faulty 
When you rappin' up on that stage and your dick fall off into the 
audience 
Silent but deadly way of murder, it's mighty sick 
Gotta have a bullet proof vest for your dick 
Seventeen with the fat hydraulics 
See, us west coast niggas is the most psychotic 
Hittin' switches in my old school with four, fuck three pumps 
My homie said that bitch had more pizzazz with "P" funk 
I'm peepin' in the bitch out at the hoe spot 
Tryin' to throw that virus to my homie 
Betta watch these bitches cause they're fake and phony... 

If you wanna get your groove on, come and do a little somethin' with 
me... 
If you wanna get your groove on, let's wrap it up before we fuck... 
If you wanna get your groove on, come and do a little somethin' with

[Don Cisco]
Yeah
Reality
She likes to fuck?
Oh, you only talk to her like that

[Verse 1: Don Cisco]
To all the cochinas
Who make it go down
Like two shots of Tequila, when I'm in your town
All I gotta do is call, baby
And all you gotta do
Is lick on my balls, baby
It's on, baby
Like arriba!
Get your ass out the sia
Go ride this pony, you, sexy mamacita
I rush to put solo
Horny
Like el toro
Don Cisco got game like King Touch
Got oro
When I love freaks with big butts, smellin' so peachy
Rubbin' on me
While I'm squeezing on they chi-chis
Mama's freaky
Got a pierce tongue and a homegirl Nikki
Like to tongue-kiss and give each other hickies
I'm puffin' sticky
Gettin' drunk with 'em off mickeys
They touchin' on my dickie while I'm pullin' on they Dickies
They wanna
Menage-a-trois
Blahs, they blah
Eat each other out raw, thang long in a jaw
So we broke all laws
Defy gravity
I show them hoes how I fill those cavities
Automatically, off alcohol and chronic leaves
And after tonight, I probably call 'em in a couple weeks

Chorus: Don Cisco
I know this chicks, she's a cochina
A fine little sexy, mamacita
She likes to get nasty
Off Tequila
And it goes down everytime I see her
Fine little sexy, mamacita
She likes to get nasty
Off Tequila
And it goes down everytime I see her

[Verse 2: Royal T]
It's a party baby
Bout to hit your town
Bout a quarter to ten
My plane touch ground
Made a reservation at the NBC suites
When I touch down, I'm a page ya, freak
Wear the neglecie, we got some games to play
By the way, baby, don't forget the Alize
I brought in all the haze so I can, smoke you out
Nasty little freak, can't wait to stroke you out
You know I love the way you be boppin' and breathin'
Blowing down on me
Slobbin' like you teethin'
My name ain't corrupt/Kurupt, but baby, We Can Freak It
Now I know how, Victoria got a Secret
Nymphomaniac
Love it from the back
After all that
Guess what you wanted
That swish
That'll throw, she swallow
Love to get nasty like it ain't no tomorrow

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 3)
[Lil' Rob]
La cochina
Means she's dirty and nasty
Everything a fucking perro wants, if you ask me
Dressed kind of slutty
But she's kinda classy
Not really fancy, but
She's kinda flashy
There's a couple people say
"She stays the same way"
And all their friends
Well, I guess, they're the same way
Now to do the grown-up
Bone down, til sun up
And she's the kind of ruka that'll always shut the fuck up

[OG Spanish Fly]
Check this puss, I been tryin' to reach ya
You got a bad case of la cochina
You can't take me cause you know I teased ya
And if you catch me drunk, then you know, I'll please ya
Sarah
Erica, I'll never take care of her
Catch me in the club, and you'll never see me next to her
Other La Cochinas in the mix today
It's how the Low Pro ganga likes to play
Uh

Repeat Chorus

Typed by: miket978@aol.com

Welcome to the Combat Zone
Check it out now
Supreme One/Chan on this motherfucker

[Verse 1]
In the Combat Zone, pimps exchange words bullets are thrown
Police barricade blocks where the ho's roam
Payphones a mini temple where the buddha moans
Territorial zones, a love jones for the fast way to paper
Disregard the maker, hammer hard into the hands of the savior
Masturbating perpetrators at the booth peepin'
Semen seepin weaken the mind of the most righteous deacon
Demon haven, souls in need of savin', murderous signs a passin' raven
Steam of the sewer raisin'
Similar to incense, immense ammunition, in an intense postition
Spidey sense intuition, tingling danglin' ornaments of Asia
Sharp stars that of phantasia graze ya, neon lights lit like the light sabre
Rotate and circulate like Darth Vader was an amazin' raver
It's the Chinatown Flava

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Step into my combat-zone-in my part of town
When worse come to worse my peoples come first
And when ya outta town represent ya ground

[Verse 2]
An old sage, confused with age
Preach what Confucious would say in this day and age
Now engaged in a modern day slave trade
Immigrants is paid more minimal than minimum wage
Little kids is taped up and raped at a scandalous age
Just ta display a picture on a pornographic page
Cookies is cracked and ate on a china plate
Discover a puzzlin' piece of paper revealin' ya fate
You'll be 'Big in Japan,'
Senate and state 'Politickin with  Chan,'
For each additional fan grippin ya hand
There's a dick in ya fam, despicable quicksand
Maneuver of an envious man, sayin "Fuck Chan!"
Even his people and land, precious rugs are traded for drugs
Thuggish hugs of suspicious love
Thats the way it is here
So many tears for fears and Sapporo beers
Put 'em up 'Cheers!'

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Step into my combat-zone-in my part of town
When worse come to worse my peoples come first
And when ya outta town represent ya ground

[Verse 3]
The flames from the dragon's mouth come out blazin'
Revealin' the most amazin' Asian adjacent ta Bruce
Blood flow with the ginseng juice
A monk meditatin' the truth, enlighten the booth
With ruthless strikes, my bare hands can take ya life
Placin' pressure on some points just right
Chinatown nights twisted, homeless hands is blistered
Battered women with broken dreams found with wrists slit
Biscuits give a repetitive pop
Paramedics inject those in shock with a remedy shot
Corrupt cops get cock sucks from sluts who fuck for bucks
In the back of tinted out trucks
It's just an observation, my miniature nation chasin'
American dreams, lovin' what liberty means
Just some thoughts from the mind
Written in rhyme, recline on my way to the Zone in the Orange Line

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Step into my combat-zone-in my part of town
When worse come to worse my peoples come first
And when ya outta town represent ya ground

My part of town [4x]

A.T.U. with DJ EQ

	Come on [scratched] "Come on"
	Come on, "Come on" Scorpion sting crush
	Come on, "Come on"
	Butterfly wing dust, scorpion sting crush
	Lion tough, lion rough

COME ON, follow and burrow and bite
I'ma twirl the line when you cross and my phenomenon strikes
Tomorrow tonight like it's the Armageddon fight
The bomb in my book, drop it when I'm ready to write
It truly run through me, like the blood's in my pen
and the ink's in my veins while I'm thinkin these thangs
Got my brain overloaded often
My life gotta change before I go to my coffin
Not in the game for sortin, we offer the pain of losses
Hope I ain't the end to pallbear
Because many are slain, I'm cautious
I'm tryin to refrain from nightmare
I'm wakin in cold sweats, I eliminate stress to my own best ability
None of you rappers shiver me timbers
What if a fashion statement Ab makes em remember
'Stract Rude with the massive agenda

	Come on, "Come on"
	I said come on, "Come on"
	Come on, "Come on" scorpion sting crush
	Come on, "Come on" scorpion sting crush

Shadowbox, hit the punch bag, acceptor
Won't win battlin, Tribe Unique's got wetter
Who that sayin the Ab ain't gainin the game
They're mistakin identity and blasphemy of my name
Breakin your energy field, lion untamed
Smartest of the artists, hardest of thugs gettin game
Like mobbers were marching that Malcolm X-type pain
Fill out the carcass with heavy blood flow, slain
Gotta rhyme for each kind in your crew
or any other solo appearance you might do
Too tight to go against, to the severity of your punishment
reflects the gravity of the offence
Heavy casualties, my battles be intense (ugh)
Your lyrical obituary reads that of the events
that took place, I gave chase, you couldn't save face
What a disgrace, that's what makes great heavyweights

	Come on "Come on"
	Come on, "Come on" scorpion sting crush
	Come on "Come on"
	Come on, "Come on" scorpion sting crush

You could train five miles on an exercise bike
but you couldn't gain my styles, we the flexin em type
Though I appear docile, I know when to get hype
You wanna make me hostile on the radio mic
And when I'm in person it's worst, my no rehearsin, free versin
And it hurts when I let my jagged edged words disperse
You won't get a word in edge, why? Cos I served ya first
You can second guess and live to rhyme, what's your purpose on Earth?
Well I write in cursive and print, and jot down in my pad
Toss out your turf in the war, til you throw out the white flag
Surrender contender, when I chop your lumbar say "Timber!"
And I got your number, 17th of November, I take you under
My inner eye, a thunder remembers like elephants
with big trunks and big tusks, big topics to discuss
Butterfly wing dust, scorpion sting crush
Lion tough, lion rough, alright

Song:   I'm Comin' Home
Typed by: davpaul@dove.net.au

Intro: Tha Realest, (Jewell)

(Hohoooow) 		Comin home y'all, look out for me
(When I'm comin)	Y'all don't have to send no more mail
(Owowoohh)
(I am comin)		Appreciate all the support and e'rything y'knowImean?
(Ooohoooh)		Good lookin out
(And I'm comin)		From your big homey, y'nahmean?
(Comin home)		Here we come, here we come

[Tha Realest]
Who'd ever figure that they'd finally get me?
It's a cold ass world they way them bastards hit me
Well I will trip and did my time like a real soldier
Didn't get to spend time with my kids as they grew older
Them jealous judges had me waitin to appeal my case
Knowin no way in hell that they'll appeal my case
I left, bowed my head when I walked the yard
And put my mean mug on at them prison guards
They hate to see me cos I had so much authority
And anybody with power had to acknowledge me, and that's no lie
Throwin spreads wit my little homies
I tried to help him with his life because my past haunts me
Inside this world we have so many rules we have to follow
I try my best in this world but all I got was sorrow
Baby I'm comin home

Chorus: Jewell

People get ready
I am comin home
I've been down you know
when I'm comin home
*repeat*

[Tha Realest]
Look at me dressed in my prison blues
Gettin visits from all the ones who kept it true
Understand that behind the walls potna it's a cold ass place
Seein my adversaries take, two shakes to the face
I can't believe the way society turned their back on me
When I was doin so much throughout communities
Come on God, am I that bad?
Do I have to get harassed by coppers and a badge?
Look at em macin me down, I got too much pride to fall to the ground
I made it, Jewell and Death Row is where we're now
It's amazin the way that I've been blessed, I guess
my time in prison was just part of the test
I wonder will it be peace when I'm released to the streets
But for now I'm all alone baby, so I'm comin home

Chorus

[Tha Realest]
Guess what? I made parole today
I had to sift for my homies from the other way, believe me y'all
I had to keep it real y'all
Ain't no holdin me back, homey it's time to go
I'm on the freeway, mashin in my drop-top red Double-R
Everyone's amazed to see this ghetto superstar
Dreams do come true
I make the effort, everyone around me can do what I can do
And that's on P-Funk, tell moms to get a meal ready
Her baby boy's comin home and believe I'm ready
You know what? I realised that I made a mistake
I lost my number one homey, it was a give and a take
I can't wait until my penetentiary dreams are gone
but until then, I'm comin home

[MC Eiht]
Geah
C'mon
Geah

Straight outta Compton, crazy muthafucka named Eiht, fool (geah)
From the gang called C-M-W
When I'm called off, I got a sawed off (boom boom!)
Squeeze the trigger, and bodies are hauled off
You too boy, if you fuck with me
One Time's gon' after come and get me
Off your ass, that's how I'm goin' out (geah)
With a gat (c'mon, uh!)
Gots pointed at (geah)
Niggas start to mumble, they wanna rumble
Mix 'em and cook 'em in a pot like gumbo (geah)
Goin' out on a muthafucka like that
with a strap, that's pointed at your ass
So give it up smooth
Ain't no tellin' when I'm down for a jack move
Here's a murder rap to keep you dancin'
With a crime record like Charles Manson (c'mon)
Tec-9 is my muthafuckin' tool
Don't make me act the gangsta fool
Cause me and you can go toe to toe, no maybe (that's right)
Knockin' niggas out the hood daily
Yo weekly, monthly, yearly
Until them mark-ass fools see clearly
that I'm down, it's the capital C-P-T
Marks can't fuck with me!
So when I'm in your neighbourhood, you better duck
Cause Eiht Loc, is crazy as fuck
As I leave, believe I'm bustin'
But when I come back, fool (c'mon)
Geah you know it's Compton

[King Tee]
Straight outta Compton
Another crazy-ass nigga
Punks I smoke, yo, my rep gets bigger
I'm a bad muthafucka and you know this
But these mark-ass niggas want show this
But I don't give a fuck, I'ma make my snaps
If not from the records to jack in and craps
Like burglary, the definition is jackin'
But when illegally armed it's called packin'
I shoot a muthafucka in a minute
Find a good piece of pussy, and go up in it
So if you're at my show in the front row
I'ma call you a bitch, or a dirty-ass hoe
You'll probably get mad like a bitch is supposed to
But that shows you slut, don't get close to
a crazy muthafucker from the street
Attitude legit because I'm tearin' up shit
King Tee controls the automatic
for any dumb muthafucker, who want static
Not the right hand cause I'm the hand itself 
Every time, I pull an A.K. off my shelf 
Security is maximum and that's the law
K-I-N-G Tee and I'm raw
See, cause I'm the muthafuckin' baller
And double baller tossin' up the ???
Ah, that ain't a place without a clue
And once their ass is in the scope, their ass is through
Look, you might take it as nigga simple
But a nigga like T is on a gangsta tip
Straight outta Compton

[Dre'sta]
Straight outta Compton
Another brother that'll smother your mother
And make your bitch think I love her
Dangerous
Muthafucka raise in hell
And if I ever get caught
I make bail
See I don't give a fuck nigga
That's the problem
I see a muthafuckin' cop I don't dodge him
But I'm smart
Lay low, creep a while
And when I see a punk pass
I smile
To me it's kinda funny
The attitude showin' nigga drivin'
But don't know where the fuck he goin' just rollin'
Lookin' for my lil' nigga Eazy
I just blast, they never seize him
Ruthless; never seen like a shadow in the dark
Except when I unload
And with the strap I blast, no hesitation
You hear the screams of the one
Who caught the last penetration
Feel a little gust of wind and I'm jettin'
But leave a memory no one'll be forgettin'
But what about the bitch who got shot? Fuck her!
You think I give a fuck about a bitch? I ain't a sucker!
This is the autobiography of the D
And if you try to fuck with me
You'll be taken, by a stupid-ass nigga that I'll smother
Beggin' like a muthafucka

Step up, run up, get up, what's up sucker?
You want some of this?
Then you're a stupid mothafucker
Kickin, like the kick from a kickdrum
Yella boy on the drum gettin' dumb
Programmin, a beat that's hittin' "that's what?"
And if you listen then you'll know we're not bullshittin'
Dope, like a pound or a Key, yeah
So shut the fuck up and listen to me

Yo, rippin' shit up, awww yeah, and here to rock you
With some help from my homeboy E

Cold funkin' it up "word up" is what we do
The reputation of the N.W.A. crew
Gettin' busy because we're cold stompin'
And we're born and raised
And we're born and raised
And we're born and raised in Compton
Now, all the ladies, all the ladies

[MC Ren]
I'm a Ruthless gangster, definition Villain
Leave your shit unlocked and he's stealin'
So call the police cause that's all you could do "but what?"
He'll get away without leavin' a clue  "yeah"
Keepin' shit in control like the neighboorhood chief 
But, referred to as a walkin' thief
They say he's a bad influence for the kids, home boy

[Dr. Dre]   Why the fuck they're blamin' him?

Yea yea yea yea, oh yea
It's the late night hype Mack B dog in the house
Chillin, like a big ol pimp
Right about now, at 3:01 in the morning
Everything else on is probably pretty faulty and repetitive
So if you're goin through your radio
When you get down to that, you know, far left hand side
Keep it tuned to Mack B dog, cuz you know
I'm keepin it extra extra funky
Know what I'm sayin?

[CHORUS]
Concentration, concentration is the name
Keep the rhythm
Or you will be out the game

We bust shots like german lugers
On intruders
Violate we activate the ill-style shooters

So Lateef [wassup?]
Let your lyrics heat-seek [all right]
And yo, get on the mic and fuck the microphone technique [here we go now]

Look what we've got
Akil, Lateef and Mark 7 deliverin the presences
J 5 Quannum
Zakir, Gab, Lyrics Born natural as the elements
I jump down and customize
My lyrics to synchronize
And educate the young, dumb, deaf, and blind
And drop a seed in they minds, so they can open their eyes
Realize and recognize we livin in the last times

I pull a spark of shining light out of the glorious fate
Create the lyric arsenals that verbal warriors make
Escape hell temporarily
Merrily vibes carry me to heavenly states
Inevitably rockin steadily

Yea, I represent the underground MC
Even though I move around I'm still down with MC's
Now pound for pound I go the round
I is down, as you see (???)
I'm from the group, Jayou, the J 5 MC's, yea

[CHORUS]

Oh god, it's so re-al, and then yet, it's sur-real
Flowin, like soy milk, over sweetened cer-e-al
Y'all melt, like toys built from cheap material
Reevaluate yourself, it ain't about the here and now

I hold it def for 6
Blazed my way up out an orphanage
Assertive it, poetic scripts blast murderous
The earth shaker, I crack a nigga out his windbreaker
The verbal layer, rhythmatic fly commentator

Yo, now if you stumble on a phonograph
To listen to the flavas that you got to have
With lyrics that be perfectly handcraft
All the way from the bay to L.A.
We're tryin to give you all different points of view
To show you our poetic words that we use
From the MC's that you're bound to choose
All the way from the bay to L.A.
[scratching]

[CHORUS]

Look what we've got
Akil, Lyrics Born, Zakir, Gift Of Gab
Lateef, Mark 7, Chali, Cut Chemist, Nu-Mark
XL, and Dj-Shadow

The rhyme ambassador that mastered the ceremony
So passengers fasten up these average cats'll never catch up

Yeah I hot dog the ball behind the yes yes y'all
Fuck hanging on the shore trying to ball ????

No, I don't jitterbug with lyrically idiotic litterbugs
They shit and bug the shit out of me eat em up for dinner so

We imburse to disperse, wish your last was your first bit
Consume the whole room and you wonder where the earth went

So I reduce the risk
Spit words like a journalist
And burnin it in unofficial mic tournaments

I'll play off night watchin trife cuz we might utilize
the mic as a rightful for the eyes on the prize (???)
So try to conduct yourself in a manner that's wise
Ain't that right? Right right, True, right right
Tell em why

We bust shots like german lugers
On intruders
Violate we activate the ill-style shooters
J 5 Quannum kick it live
orth with the South, civil war with the rhymes
We bust shots like german lugers
On intruders
Violate we activate the ill-style shooters
J 5 Quannum kick it live

Life is like a big merry-go-round
You're up and then down
Going in circles trying to get to where you are.
Everybody's been counting you out
Where are they now?
Sitting in the same old place
Just faces in the crowd.
We all make mistakes
You might fall on your face
But you gotta get up!

[Chorus]
I'd rather stand tall
Than live on my knees
'Cause I am a conqueror
And I won't accept defeat!
Try telling me no
One thing about me
Is I am a conqueror
I am a conqueror!
Ooh oh

Got a vision that no one else sees
Lot of dirty work, roll up your sleeves
Remember there's a war out there
So come prepared to fight!
You never know where the road leads you
Not everyone's gonna believe you
And even know they're wrong, don't prove them right.

[Chorus]
I'd rather stand tall (tall)
Than live on my knees (can't live on my knees)
'Cause I am a conqueror
And I won't accept defeat!
Try telling me no (no)
One thing about me (one thing about me)
Is I am a conqueror
I am a conqueror!
Ooh oh (Ooh oh)
I am a conqueror!

We all make mistakes
You might fall on your face
But you gotta get up!
We all make mistakes
You might fall on your face
Don't ever give up!

[Chorus]
I'd rather stand tall (oooh)
Than live on my knees (can't live on my knees)
'Cause I am a conqueror (I am a conqueror)
And I won't accept defeat! (And I won't accept defeat)
Try telling me no (try telling me no)
One thing about me (one thing about me)
Is I am a conqueror (is I am a conqueror)
I am a conqueror!
Ooh oh (Ooh oh)
I am a conqueror!

We all make mistakes
You might fall on your face
But I am a conqueror!

Like I drink a bottle of belvi' chased it with NyQuil
And I'm parle'yin on the celli', see how my ice feel?
The way it go, they wanna know if I pay a light bill
Don't you ever think about bumpin me cause I'm quite strill?
Then I go fold me a brother faster then light will
If da' car don't get to whippin, ??? the bike wheel
In for a slight heel
Peace brother, it was quite real
How you figure the night feel
If you breathe, then it might heel
Or I'm leavin it tight steel
And I'm holding a tight wheel
?? whores shoe
Then I come back and toss too
This what you walk through
Megaphones you talk through
Have a bitch walk, when the angel carrying pitchforks
Mad cause we banging on they head with them six-fours
And we got them sick whores
And they sipping liquor
And we finna get more, get more..

[Chorus]
Money - COOL
Girls - COOL
Diamonds - COOL
Cars - COOL

[Verse 3]
With some tie I'm bout to go to the party and get my drink on
But I can't go to the party without my mink on
Links on..
Rings on..
Both of my earrings on
Don't you hear the theme song?
Time to get my lean on
Catch hype flight at the party but I don't mean wrong
I'm just trying to tell everybody, listen my team strong
We gone dream on
Didn't I say my team strong?
Don't you see the beam on?
Time to get my steam on

[Chorus]
Money - COOL
Girls - COOL
Diamonds - COOL
Cars - COOL

[Verse 4]
Is I'm drunk? I like to ride in the Benz but stay in the back though
Hat low with gat on
Run through with that slow
Cap yo, ass
Pat ya down for cash
After I find the stash
Put the gat down and then dash
Check the moves so swift
Who you gonna get?
Got the mova on the hip
And it's you I'm gonna split
Is it you I'm gonna hit?
Even if I miss ya
Get somebody that's with ya
So you get the picture
Think its a game
Lemme entertain
Let ya people explain how I crept up with them thangs
How I snuck up in the game
The best wasn't the same
They covered they chest in blang
He's nothing to mess with mane'
Stuck up in the game, I had to trust in the name
I had to lust for the fame, I'm busting before I aim
Disgusted at all the things
I'm hustling for the team
I'm struggling for the cream
It musta been for the dream

[Chorus]
Money - COOL
Girls - COOL
Diamonds - COOL
Cars - COOL

[Outro]
Yeah its smooth, cause you wouldn't wanna ride with me
??? Come Back and you gone wanna spot with me
How many of my people gonna go get high with me?(High With Me[Repeated 4x])
How many of yall people that's gone ride with me?
How many of yall people that's gone get high with me?
How many of yall people that's down to ride with me?

In the d-d-day I put my dilli on Dayna's and Pirelli's
Gettin high so I Think I Can Fly like R.Kelly
And be all of my niggas Gz and none of my nigga's punks
We flippin down tha Interstate, crump and matchin blunts
I stay pissy head drunk, ya dig money?
In a Cadillac Maurice that I got from Frank Ten
I've been plus Five Percent bein rolled up
Talkin outerstate drug deals on my blow up, mo' hash nigga
Hold up your fuckin wism, rollers in lockin
and have that ass capped, sent it from my mo', I told ya
You need a fix, nigga what's the word on it?
Rollin in a pancake zigga with tha zerb on it
Dayna's and Vogues is how I roll when I'm smokin
And tinted windows, and let em up if you get nosey
???? and colds supposedly, I do away with them J's
In a GS300, gettin blunted, on a tollway, hey

Chorus

I'm like the Pips, I'm just Gladys Knight
19 is Dayna's with the two-inch whites, I'm served tight
Lookin like a nigga should be in Vogue, cos I'm parked
with the hella flashers sittin on Vogues in the dark
I sparks me a Dutch, plus paper drinkin my nut
And be mashin on the gas or the brake and the clutch
See young Doob like south is such, nigga what?
I pick your pocket like Deion and run it straight up the gut
Then I cut to the sidelines swervin then drop up my pick up
And Earvin then picked up my bourbon, for certain
It's all ta see, me, cos we's Gz
20-inches with the TV, fo' scheezy
Believe me, ya gettin murdered and touched, then we burst
I'm like Jordan up in the clutch, bitch I don't miss when it counts
We bring the narrows in mass amounts, is y'all wit me?
If you need to re-up or sto', then y'all hit me (get me?)

Chorus

Young Doob on the escapade in the Cadillac
Escalate with mo' ice than the Icecapades
I graze niggas like razorblades, I'm tailor made
>From bald to blade to Frankie Beverly and maize
I'm paid, I stay with real killers, and gold getters
Been raised on cornbread and collard green niggas
And Fubu and Hilfiger's, Bailey's and Vigour's
If ya want us niggas, then come get us, we killers
>From the city of the Tezas Rangers and high rollers
In a Lexus Landrover that I flipped over
I'm drunk and barely sober, prayin to Jehovah
in hope that this hopelessness don't push me over
I'm just a young baller with nathin to lose
Payin my dues in Oriental tattoos
Drankin and pourin out brews for lost fools
who niggas pushed bourb, wood with the zerb
And we all bi-coastal but we claim the 3rd
Where niggas swerve, pimp serve and do the dirty bird, ya heard?!?
	Death Row South, ya check me?
	From Texas
	Where nothin changed but the necklace

Chorus (x2)

Death Row's finest nigga!
The South's finest nigga!
I'm gone! I've been handed the motherfuckin torch!
You bitch made niggas don't want none, you heard me?!?

Uh, uh, cos I'm COUNTRY!!!

[Stalley]
As a kid I had a lot of money
Knotted up, rubberband money
Next to that Xbox, thrown in my Jordan box
I think it was my 13's something that I rarely rocked
White and black high top, i used to wear the high socks
Back when I was ballin', shootin' 3's for a dollar
I was hustlin' niggas back then, buyin' momma scratch and wins
Stackin my ends, tryin' to get that Robinson
Cause pop was robbin', beatin' 'em back then, I mean back when it was in my life
I still had to think, for my life, it was good with that
Dicky pants and suit and tie; let me decide which way to go
Changes tire wages out to the day I expire so
BCG's Russian, Blue Collar to the buckle
All my deals done, Midwest nigga with the locs on
Been getting this since Voltron, kung-fu grip, Bufon
When it comes to getting this paper I'm like Kobe and Lebron

[Chorus 2X: Stalley] 
Coupes and roses, flowers for the dead
Fresh made, we bow our heads, give thanks for this bread
Lord keep us safe and our families out the feds
My OG asked it square, and this is what he said: he should

[Stalley]
Expensive habits, I'm a addict for golden kicks
Leather bunkers and dark skinned chicks
What can I say? I like to floss a bit
Spend money like a faucet drain, sweat pants inside vans like a Boston nigga
Everybody say I'm awesome, shit
I'm just makin money talkin' this
Never made one cent off a toss in a blink
I hustled diamonds, got my hands dirty, cleanin my wrist
Gold gat, no rope, still emotion is sick
Blue collar, clean Impala, automatic no stick
In case in trip automatics who grip protect possessions
Don't condone a weapon but they out to catch us slippin'
When you livin' like this the poor fish on the rich
Court seats in the Knicks, shout to Marn, my nigga
The harder I work more lavish I live
Not bad for a kid who always started with kicks

(Littles Verse)
Yo, yo, yo, hey yo

Couldn't trust friends much fuck dodging the D's

Who the youngest thug that ever lived blocks I quoting
I'm a legend and these city streets, give me props
'Cause when I'm A-K speak niggas call the cops
41st Side man, what block you rep?
15 I was holding down I hold projects

(Wiz of "The Braveharts" Verse)
See when my niggas catch bodies I fucks up the crime scene
G-W-I-Z don't see police
I pocket shells guns move your bodies trajectory
From where the bullet entered then fucked up the police
Investigation that'll be the only retaliation
Scoop Teflon's blue and red lights reflection
Fuck it, still pick up the weapon and keep stepping
Get bag, come home in time to ditch the weapon

(Prodigy & [Lake] Hook)
Yo listen thun the hood love us

Yo Blitz and "Jung" spit your life on it

With that infared beam like see a nigga spit
See me on the street, see these cowards bolt when I aim
Now see this nigga leak, faggot should of noticed my pain 
All these cardboard killers I'll box y'all, multiple shots y'all
Death breathing out of them glocks yall
Fear no streets, fear no beef
Leave niggas in loving memory and feel no grief

Yo It's Jungle from the braveharts for all y'all dummies

Mother fucker I'll cut your blue coogie off
You can catch me on the 40th side of Vernon QB north

(Prodigy & [Lake] Hook)
Yo listen thun the hood love us

Faul Monday & Germ put your stripes on it

(Germ's Verse)
Yo, Yo 
Some niggas different niggas gotta make the right moves
Niggas choose to run around and wanna wave they tools
'Til somebody lay you flat and give you permanent shoes
Ashy gray cement like the color of tombs
And y'all boys aint menace still trying to get made
Don't make me spread you around like ??? with aids
And I, laying slugs in you just like fades
It's like a one and a half going 'gainst your brain

(Faul Monday verse)
Hey yo, fuck y'all
Anything moving it's a rentals Dog
Faul Monday loading up then heat it up like leather scarfs
Get your lady clapped in her mouth, tell her to shut up
It's Queensbridge thugging you out give me your dub ups
Go 'head reach for it
The reverend don't preach for it
When Jesus never plays goalie with bullets you'll leak for it
So get your head pealed over the passenger side
Who you fucking with dies
Throw in Lakey stickers then ride

(Prodigy's Outro)

Typed by: ja_rule@lowrider.com

[Royal T]
Another day, I cruise at the beach
Car sitting low, my homey's in the next seat
It's the Royal, rims clean with the top back
Rep for summer with the locs and the baseball hat
Down 805, cuties in the next lane
Trying to draw attention, their number and their name
We didn't get no play we got ignored
But there's too many cuties in the sea to fish for
I pulled up in the spot in the parking lot
Sipping on a 40 at the corner cuz it gets hot
Cutties checking out the cars that we roll
Black candy with the rims with the booms and the gold
Here comes the pigs, turn it down they're getting nearer
Checking out the vatos with the dice in the mirror
But we ain't villains that be stepping out of line
We like going cruising with the cutties in the summertime

[Chorus x2: Bizz]
From the coast to the avenue
Our crew is deep, I thought you knew
Hitting switches in my 64
Baby don't you know
We be rolling

[Latino]
I said trucks rolling by with the boom-booms in em
I sling Sly shirts with the Levi denim
A late night tings in after day time
Vatos looking loco, hynas looking fine
The veterano's got the switches to the side
The truck's full of amps in the back of the g-ride
Everybody's styling, Profile's Low
I'm driving real slow, looks like a big car show
I peep the cutties with the light Brown complection
Gotta bust a U and go the opposite direction
Pina Coloda, room at the Ramada

[Royal T]
Parties at the beach if it gets any hotter
Cholos in bandanas, nobody's down to bang
Let the rags hang, it's a Mexican thang
We ain't villains that be stepping out of line
We like going cruising with the cutties in the summertime

[Chorus x2]

[Royal T]
Cooling by the shore, hynas cooling in the sand
Lotion in their hand with a summertime tan

[Latino]
I said homies kicking back in the shade drinking brew
Have one or two, but they're down to drink a few
Too many drinks when the evening arrive
Pass the keys to the homey, it ain't safe to drink and drive

[Royal T]
Four five burning, sea breeze blowing
Ladies dress sexy, body half showing
Trying to draw attention, Latino had I mentioned
Pack in the glove, don't forget about prevention
When we hit the motel it's almost 1 o'clock
Everything closed so we head to Heidi's Taco Shop
Cutties wanna roll, the lab is where we sent em
Taking em to the room, we did the wild thing with em
But we ain't ones to wine and dine
I'd rather cruise at the beach with the cutties in the summertime

"Second Round's on Me" (get it together)
Kuniva, Ca$his (I ain't goin nowhere)
Stat Quo, Bobby Creekwater (O. Trice) WHAT!

[Obie Trice]
Niggaz didn't kill me, now a nigga's gone (yeah)
Can't, peel my cap back, I'm never at home (ha!)
I'm somewhere, with my shaft restin on a hoe's tongue (word)
Sippin Dom Perignon while she sippin up them newborns
Yeah, bet ya hate the news holmes (nigga!)
He probably somewhere, sippin on a stoop, huh?
Sippin on a brew, plottin to pop me later huh? (haha)
When will a hater learn I'm too great on a song
I push weight on the corner, send weight to the coroner
When courage make him turn performer
I transform into Uma Therman, a dude's version
Verses lettin a 'perfluous nigga with no purpose (woo!)
Continue to walk this earth's surface
I was birthed in hip-hop, watch out my services (that's right)
Yet, you tried to murder this nigga that's comin
from the same turf as you's (NIGGA) what nerve of you's (NIGGA)
Pissed cause your hustles ain't worth a shit (NIGGA!)
I'm gettin rich, I'm on my way to Hugh Hefner's, dig?
With a bitch you in the trenches tryin to reach it big (ah-ha!)
On another rapper's dick who don't represent where you live (DUMMY!)
Know you're annoyed but don't make the mistake
I'm state to state in that Honda nigga, not an Accord (woo)
I'm in that Honda G4 you would never afford (woo)
And yep, it's probably ease when a nigga is on board

[Chorus: Obie Trice]
{"Cryyyyy now"} Cry now
{"Cryyyyy now"} Cry now
{"Cryyyyy now"} Cry now
{"Cryyyyy now"} Nigga cry now

[Kuniva]
I'll be damned if I let a nigga lay his hands on me
I'll lay his ass out and park a Grand Am on him
The city where the weak survive and the strong die
Where beef collide, shootouts happen and hit the wrong guy
I done seen the worst of the worst - and what can be worse
than a verse about bullets dispersed up in your shirt
The streets is like a curse, niggaz frontin for a bitch
It's like you beggin to die like bear huntin with a switch
A part of my heart is gone, I can never smile the same
Trigger finger is itchy, it'll take a while to tame
Detroit is hella Dirty but the Dozen can fix it
Resist and a biscuit will excede the distance
And bounce off one's home, hit and ricochet
Off a kid's trombone right to where you niggaz lay
Obie can tell you that death is just a few inches away
I shed tears but you can get your fill of it today

{"Cryyyyy now, cryyyyy now, cryyyyy now, cryyyyy now"}

[Bobby Creekwater]
Yo, Obie, they gonna fuck with us this time nigga (B-G-O-V)
Uh, Bobby Creek, nigga

Laugh now, cry never, my beretta is a body part
Hit 'em with just enough shots to make his body art
Now I feel like we even
See Creek is here to shine a light on you niggaz this evenin
Soon as I get my call I'm right on them zeros I'm leavin
Load up a clip and make it dark on them heroes I'm cheesin
Shit they got snitches on the clock, gotta watch what I sayin
Me buy a bitch a couple rocks in a watch? Quit playin
Back on my grizzy my nizzy, nobody ran with me
And for them fuckin spectators I brought the band with me
Halftime niggaz, and grab pine you would never grab mine nigga
The doc was lyin when he said you gon' be fine nigga

[Eminem] Ca$his!

[Ca$his]
Witness the art of war, in the physical (geah!)
Since raw coke was rushed through my umbilical (uhh c'mon)
And no words from Ca$h mouth is fiction (what?)
Ready to throw clips if, I'm never dissin you
My aura awards raw to the core and the surface
of the street, when I walk through the door, my purpose
is to move up, pull towards you purp'in
Watch me overthrow the government for my interpret
Plot of Bin Laden, soul of Mumia
I'm prayin to Proof, I'm +Searching for Jerry Garcia+
Talk to my brother, gone in the streets of the D
I'm totin the K, at hawk niggaz waitin on me
You take the first shot then, +Second Round's on Me+
And when you walk, on the other side of me, and my brother ride
I don't rap for the plaques
My contract's signed just for scraps to get you wacked
Nigga, with a gun, with a shank, with a bat
Take a slug through the lung, get it right, what you wack nigga
I'm born crazed deranged and more famous
than clappin down bangers meant, for entertainment, geah

[Chorus]

[Stat Quo]
Young Stat keep the gat on tuck
Want war, I don't give a fuck
Shot 'til you kiss, pucker up
It'll lift him up, believe me you'll float
The result is your family heartbroke (YEA!)
Lookin like an artichoke vegetable, hold stiff
Nigga paralyzed from the neck down, my goons stick niggaz
Turn soldiers to stick figures, hand on triggers
Real life, born killers, we roll out like four-wheelers
God shill us, from back-stabbers and goldiggers
Tipsy off brown liquor, watch me
Obnoxious, broads call me cocky
Poppy long dick Stat beat up the box like hockey
Especially when a bitch ride dick like jockeys
From the Benz, to the Range, to the black jalopy
I'm the shit, the only one who ain't heard is Foxy
Formalize the plan, no man can stop me
Boss hog, Stat Quo understand, you COPY?
You COPY?

What? Ugh, what? Ugh
Yeah (ha ha) check it out

Are you a rapper or a criminal who's tired of livin minimal
These labels wanna burn you, so a lotta rappers turn to
the streets, where mine don't eat, sheets, now beats
No record plays, back to the old days and old ways
To a hustle, back around like a belt buckle
Yo it's a struggle, for a dealer who can't shuffle
I throw the three up, plus I'm gon' be up
Hit my man on the hip, plus a nigga gotta re-up
No more bein sociable, goin on promotional
tours or in-stores, music floodin them seats indoors
Back on the block breakin laws
You was just up in the sky with the stars
Thinkin about a Lexus, now you gettin restless
Cut off from the guest list, now manifest this and test these
waters, cos your per dium's ain't feedin niggas' sons and daughters
It'll make a thug harder, I'll know

	[Kool DJ EQ scratching]
	"You can't trust nobody" (x8)

Yeah
And fake friends with fake grins and fake skins
Wonder why you're one's ain't ten's, concerned with ends
It feel hectic, plus it's real hectic
How many entertainers went from hit records to jail records?
They thought their deal was their meal ticket (Yeah)
Went from a pack of double mint, to a single chicklet
I show 'n' tell, you never fall til you fell
and hurt yourself, over-exert yourself
You got to go and get the shovel and dig the dirt yourself
Learn how to work yourself, assert yourself
In this game of masturbation, you got to jerk yourself
And try to spread like Ebola, it's not always the real thing
like Coca-Cola, a baby couldn't move without a push from his stroller
Too many turn to drugs, they can't deal with it sober
And it's a big chance that you ain't never gettin over
But I don't know

Ah-hah, ahaha
This is tripped out, tripped out
I wonder what you look like?
Haha, like dat like dat
	Well where you at?
	Where you at?  Where you at?  Where you at?
Buk buk!!

You are the pain, that puts stress on my brain
How do I refrain, from making you a bloodstain?
Just a memory would suffice; it would be nice
I would love to see your face, it would be tight
Who are you?  How old are you?  How tall are you?
What do you think of the daughter that wants to meet you?
Do I have your smile and your eyes that have kept me strong?
Will you ever be man enough to show your face;
will you roll on the situation, a nation will rise
no higher than this woman, a fatherless child
Let me ask you some'in: is that you asleep on the sidewalk
with no place to stay and with no one to talk?
Maybe you have a wife and kids and a big house
Or maybe you're a business man with the big clout
Who knows how the story goes, maybe I will see
I'm just a fatherless child, filled with curiosity

	Sometimes, I get a little lonely
So where you at?
Where you at?  Where you at?  Where you at?
	Sometimes, I wonder why it had to be this way
	You know, I wonder who you are
So where you at?
Where you at?  Where you at?  Where you at?
	Do you know that I'm here?

My homies and family claim not to understand me
Why do I talk with so much emotion
and why do I feel so deeply?  Huh
I have this habit of bitin my nails when I'm deep in thought
Did you do the same, did you get slapped when you got caught?
Sometimes I feel my soul is tired from the lack of sleep
It won't rest until I see you and you see me
I remember when I asked my momma, "Where is he?"
She said you died, in a plane crash overseas
I remember cause momma used to get mad zooted
So two years later I asked again and she had to prove it
She couldn't, in fact, she forgot what she said the first time
When I asked again, she said you died in a car crash, fine
But momma you lied to me and my friends were right
This is the real reason why this case was sealed tight
Help me to understand what's going on with this man
who I've never seen or met, tell me did you plan
for me not to see, some pieces of this puzzle
are missing in action, I feel that this is trouble
She said, "You really wanna know?  God please help me
I didn't know your father, THE BASTARD RAPED ME!"

So where you at?
Where you at?  Where you at?  Where you at?
It's like dat like dat now

Do my ears deceive me, I'm confused, do they tease me
because of the man I thought was dad, took my mother and..
forced her to - I CAN'T SAY IT MAN!
What's this world comin to, why'd you do my moms fool??
She was only thirteen, you betta find yo' screws
because like you, I am a fool too
Let me take that back, I don't wanna be like that
But now you listen and pay witness to this raw facts
Life is a three-sixty, what goes around comes around
and back to your cypher, it will come to haunt you down
Who knows, you probably turned over a new leaf
You might be pushin up daisies, if so it wouldn't amaze me
In fact, let's be accurate, it wouldn't fade me
Rape, is punishable by death, alright bet
Now here we go cause God is bringin me to my knees
to deal with the pain of my, secret curiosity

	Sometimes, I get a little lonely
So where you at?
Where you at?  Where you at?  Where you at?
	Sometimes, I wonder why it had to be this way
	You know, I wonder who you are
So where you at?
Where you at?  Where you at?  Where you at?
	Do you know that I'm here?
Do you know?  Do you know?

	Sometimes, I get a little lonely
So where you at?
Where you at?  Where you at?  Where you at?
	Sometimes, I wonder why it had to be this way
Like dat, like dat
	You know, I wonder who you are
	Do you know that I'm here?
So where you at?  Where you at?

It's like dat, like dat now..
It's like dat, like dat now.. what?
It's like dat, like dat now..
Artist: The Fedz
Album:  Suave House Compilation
Song:   Death Notes
Typed by: compbuttons@hotmail.com

[Intro]
(Death) To die, the state of being lifeless
It's the psychic that's on the creep
Bringing heat to all the projects, sets, boundaries
Now when you see these, here they're coming over sea with no key
Bringing death notes to all images in the rap industry (Death)
We gladly present to you, the scientist

[Verse 1]
There's no time left, eject the tape, niggas evacuate the set
Jet, I'm leaving notes laced with death on your doorsteps
Make your last request, eternal rest your destination
Premeditation murder, a result of aggravation
These sticky situations got me in a zone, polish the chrome
Prone to demolish these niggas like Sly Stallone
If loving the game is wrong, I don't wanna be correct
Those who ride in my set get outlined like silhouettes
So death's a blackout, don't ask about my riches
I cast a spell on the snitches, my cliental are the strictest
I'm predicted, niggas get twisted with my scientifics
Witness this I increase my salary by six digits
Wiping out all existence, get diminished instantly
Tonight's the night, and we mobbing through your city making history
I'm mentally abusive, undisputed
No need to interview me, my lyrics debut, they exclusive

[Hook]
We believe in death notes, for those that approach
Lay comatose, it's gun smoke on every coast
We believe in death notes, for those that approach
Lay comatose, it's gun smoke on every coast
We believe in death notes, for those that approach
Lay comatose, it's gun smoke on every coast

[Verse 2]
My mood swings like a noose, fuck ya juice
Strictly gun play put down your dukes
I produce evil and seduce
Diabolical thoughts for onslaught
Causing casualties, many ones afford inside your mental
Visitation from hitmen with mack tens, stacking when we sin
Bitch your block bodies drop, when we bend the corner
So killers are now up on ya,
We plot paper with homies from Chi-Town to the hills of California
The aroma of gunsmoke, choke niggas
Worldwide, suicide you will confront, Suave House until the day I die
I get cocked like warlocks, the sinister doctor Bombay
Casting spells with this fully loaded AK
Bodies lay in ruin, dirty like urine in a drug test
Don't stress, I'm just a lyrical murder vest
I project and see caskets for the words that I graph
Gats hold my signature nigga, here's my autograph

[Hook]

[Extending Hook]
(Death) This is your last notice, (Notes) ha ha ha ha ha
(Death) So tell me are you afraid, (Notes)
How does it feel looking down (Death) the eyes of death (Notes)
Ha ha ha ha (Death) ha ha ha ha ha (Notes) ah ha ha ha ha

[Verse 3]
Time to get the G's, must get the dough and
Increase before I release the flows and expose it straight smoking
Shit like sticks, increasing grips, we taking trips to hit the streets
So niggas flip and dip to the scientist's arranged lyrics, like chemists
(No gimmicks) I'm in to diminish ya like the wizard, who is it
It's ol' Ste (and the L-O-K-E-Y) you can't see we

[Verse 4]
It's a lyrical drive-by, the scientist on the creep
I tweak now watch me take this level to the highest peak
To each his own, my songs is full of killers and cap-peelers
The mats and gats zippers you can ask the Sinister
About me, I slip though the night like hockey skis
To see Professor Lo-Key, cause mister clocking G's
For fulfilling his prophecies, it's the narrator
And it's the black Noreaga slash international playa

[Hook]

[Extending Hook]
(Death) Ha ha ha ha, now there you have it (Notes)
(Death) The scientist on a creep to kill (Notes)
(Death) This shit don't get no realer than this (Notes)
So (Death) sinist-sinister, my nigga (Notes) the L-O-K-E-Y
(DIE!)

[Dame Dash] ** (Cam'Ron) **
Hopefully, y'all enjoying the album, as of yet
My name is still Dame Dash and I'm still the CEO
And I wanna take this time to kick it with my nigga Cam and my nigga Jimmy
You know, we kinda came up around the same way
110th.. 109th... 142nd.. 140th
And if I could rap, Cam, I'm telling you
I swear to God, I'd talk my shit.. (I know)
I'd talk about how I got that money and copped them cakes.. 
(Yeah, I got you, though) Cam, please man, COME ON!!
 
[Cam'Ron]
In '87, dog, my man, Dame, was a cake copper
Eighth chopper, now, he got a gray chopper
Harlem, Brooklyn, Philly, the whole state's proper
Shrimp, steak, forty-second, they ate lobsters
He used to stack up his chips
Crashed up his whip lookin' back at a bitch
Left it, 'F' it, we bout to get twelve Jeeps
'91, barbershop on 12th street
Yeah, we turned dope into dollars
Front haircuts, back 'dro in the bottle
Any beef? Cam is in place
Yeah, we got the bricks off of Hamilton Place
Papi came down with product in the bag
Put the crackhead in the taxi and we followed the cab
Downtown, no, we took 'em
We called Dookie, drove him over to Brooklyn
Their baby's mother, she once got the drop on us
We copped a bird and the bitch called the cops on us
Dame took me off the block
Hand to hand to handling the coffee pot
 
[Dame Dash]
Thanks, Cam, I appreciate it, but man
That's not enough, I still got some shit on my mind
I still see the cars.. I still see the fact that we were stars
I still see the rooftop.. 
Don't get it twisted, now, this ain't no song, like I said
I just got some shit I wish I could say
I can't rap.. matter fact, Jimmy, you first to def.. tell 'em somethin'
Please, tell niggas how to get this money
 
[Jim Jones]
You still got visions of the rooftop
I got visions of this Coupe drop wit invisible rooftops
One of the first, to cop cases of drinks
Cash, cars, racin' from the rink and skatin' the minks
Shit, how hard is my team?
We started from fiends, turnin' buildings to Carters, naw mean?
That's Harlem, now we partyin', sparrin' Eugene's
Bag bitches wit the bottoms from dreams
We rich, yeah.. rip up ya tar wit cars and new beams
Cop rims for every car on my team
Call shots.. Dame, I'm just poppin' my fizzle
I drop the top when it drizzle, this is what cocky can get you
Fresh to def, we move the block of that sniffle
Up on the block wit them pistols, we give a fuck if the
Cops'll come get you, Gangsta!! Man, shit, we the sickest
Some is for war, we rip up the tickets after the cops.. can you feel this?
 
[Dame Dash]
Man, that shit was hot
Pause.. I hope nobody's mad about that
I just had to get some shit off my chest
Matter fact, my man, FUCK YOU!!
You don't appreciate a nigga gettin' money
You don't appreciate a muthafucka that knows how to hustle
You don't appreciate a nigga that's seen a million dollars
And in that case, you ain't never gone see it
Niggas better get they mind right
'Cause I got enough fresh for one-thousand days straight!!
I could pop tags everyday for the rest of the decade!!
I'M DAME DASH!!! HOLLA!!!

You ain't heard the last of me
Them No Limit Soldiers down to blast for me
I'm no stranger to danger
Ain't no fear in my heart
I'm the one in the chamber
Known as the ghost in the dark 

Its that slant eyed nigga from Pep who done gave his last warning
That if you fuck around wit me your fuckin family mourning
I'm serious
I'm on that mission 
Taking niggaz position 
Was brought up hustlin and head bustin somethin against yo religion
My entourage is ghetto niggaz thats been trained to flex wit triggaz
Tottin A-K's and explosives straight puttin niggaz in half like Moses
Niggaz start pushin roses
If they fuck wit this soldier
Son I'll smoke you like doulja 
and break you down like a boulda 
Its that down south heat holda leavin you blood clot 
from a slug shot
Fuck a leg shot 
or a head shot
Won't stop til I see red spots
They call the people they would run if they smart
Cause of a murder that can't be caught 
The fuckin Ghost in the dark

You ain't heard the last of me
Them No Limit Soldiers down to blast for me
I'm no stranger to danger
Ain't no fear in my heart
I'm the one in the chamber
Known as the ghost in the dark 

You ain't heard the last of me
Them No Limit Soldiers down to blast for me
I'm no stranger to danger
Ain't no fear in my heart
I'm the one in the chamber
Known as the ghost in the dark 


They call me cast wit a body snatcha ghost in the darkness
Trained to be heartless 
and be release my rapture on my target
I travel at the speed of light and holla BLOCKA when Im comin
Niggaz depend on me when it's time for redrumin somethin
I can your worst nightmare or your closest nigga
Im the motherfuckin round hopin you pull the trigga
I got murder on my mind so please aim and squeeze
So I can make our motherfuckin enemies bleed

Now it's the Phantom that bust at random wit 6 slugs
Wit the blood shot runna runnin wit the ghost from Pepper (HOLLOWWAY!)
In the streetz at midnight we meet
the unlivin versus the weak
the flammable against the heat (RESPECT THE FLAME)

I hear church bells ringin at the Graveyard 
While Im jackin niggaz in the project wit Machetes leavin my trademark
They know Im comin but they can't see me 
They feel my presence but they can't kill me 
Cause Im a ghost immortal 'g' see

You ain't heard the last of me

I'm no stranger to danger
Ain't no fear in my heart

[Talib Kweli]
Yo you think that, it's crazy man?
This brother from South Africa told me that there's like
a Tupac tribe, and a Biggie tribe right?
And heads got like AK-47's and machine guns and
and and and Africans killin each other
over some East coast/West coast, knahmsayin?
I mean that we deaded it a long time ago man
but lives is bein lost, yaknahmsayin?
Over some bullshit, yaknamsayin?
I don't really understand it yo

[Wordsworth]
Yo, reality is life and death, full of fights and threats
Murders, burglars, prostitutes search the night for sex
Rollin dice on steps, take advice from vets, brains are bright in death
and you can have accounts that never bounce from writin checks
Life and tecs, there ain't really much here
Either sports video games you deal or cut here
Jeeps or Porshes, a portion of dreams in fortune
Intercourse that I'm stressed to keep it or abortion
My topics full of plans, on profit from this land
A pocket full of grands to have your optics full of fans
I'm tired of dollar bands, shoppin carts pushin cans
and jobs ain't callin back, you better off pullin scams
To rack props, cops harass black blocks
Parents addicted, kids on they colors from crack tops
for jacktops, pistols instead of tissue muscle to bust you
You got a choice, either b-boy or drugs can rush you

[A.L.]
Life is too short, that's why I strive to live it to the fullest
Half my brothers are locked up, the other half a caught a bullet
To pull it, it's kinda strange like every night I got a full moon
I used to pull boom, hopin one day I'd drop a jewel soon
but hard to see that, with so many problems in my picture
My car ? that, I try to soft it with the liquor
We're dissolvin quicker, my streets are hotter than Cancun
Backstabbers'll shank you, say more than thank you and prank you
They're brainwashin us, that's why I never use the shampoo
The game knockin us, that's why I'm clever when the cam zooms
So what's the reason for the treason who you pleasin when you skeezin
Bullets breezin every season leavin bodies freezin
Forget excuses, puttin the blame up on the flamer
Hip-Hop is useless, when entertainers hit containers
Simple and plainer but crime is gettin stranger
Wrinkles my gainer, but in time we'll live in danger
No remainders in my chamber my eras are filled with toxicant
Lyrics my oxygen I get the spirits from my moccassins
My mouth is where I dropped my gem, I made the glock my friend
No peace in the East, little kids is throwin rocks again

Chorus: Talib Kweli

It's only one life to live so I sacrifice
But nobody came back from the afterlife
Life and death is the fate of the streets
Take it day by day, pray before I eat, pray before I sleep
One life to live so I sacrifice
When nobody came back from the afterlife
Life and death is the fate of the streets
Take it day by day, pray before I eat, pray before I sleep

[Talib Kweli]
The survivor of slavery, definition of bravery
Flowin like Brooks bust Nines in Deep Space like Avery
With rhymes made to be complete like A to Z
or the number nine the months of pregnancy, what can you say to me?
Call up the travel agency, book a flight to the end of time
when the wicked get refined, the righteous kick a rhyme livin divine
Rewind, to the present state of mind right now
where beef will have you dead like the first man to catch Mad Cow
Life is full of too much trifeness to chill and be enjoyin
I be in the inner city like asbestos and lead poison
My memories within the cannon of history
Ready aim spit-fire my artillery, in the faces of cats who grillin me
(Yo what you lookin at?)  Quick to touch up cats who ain't feelin me
with the ability, to plug you in, like auxillary
Livin digitally, the only condition is critically
You still the man physically but I'm sunnin you spiritually
Consider me far from average, lyrical rites of passage
Rhymes comin out my cabbage, cold light up a savage
Take you back to baby carriage, yo, for what it's worth
Drop a master verse before they cleaned up the afterbirth

[Punchline]
Aiyyo since I was teethin, I was labelled a heathen
A demon, my pops must have had bad semen
Now all eyes peepin, the man with the raps
Been kickin since the womb and my moms felt that
Train of thought off track, cause I couldn't F widdit
I taught myself to hold ground on one pivot
and never be timid, call me the rap God
A slave to the game just like Amistad
I rap eager, a daydreamer
I seen cats dance for crack, like Gator in Jungle Fever
While the thugs bust shots til it just don't stop
I'll have a fat knot, controllin finances through the laptop
Enhancin your mind, at night when I rhyme
I spit gems that shine havin you thinkin it's daytime
I be the final sign, at any rate, opposin debate
for all rappers with militant mindstates

You're walkin' down a dead end street
I said you're walkin' down a dead end street
Fuckin' with me
You're walkin' down a dead end street
I said you're walkin' down a dead end street
"And you can't cross me"

Verse 1:
It's not necessary to lay a fowl tongue on me my friend
That only leads to dead ends tu comprende comprehend?
I'm a human warhead
Please mercy you know bet 
Bucacom with the knowledge of wealth that I'm a shed
Break bread death breeds money Bucfusius said
But I ain't gonna die alone I put somebody to bed
I ain't Sylvester but I'm still a looooone young Judge Dread
And to the streets I plead 
Down with the hardest of heads
Call my Bucky the Kid or Buctradomus
King Buc for short or King Buc and Common
Campaign Bucanomics
Sucka free street movements are bionic
High power supersonic movin' faster than comets
Indian ? worth my weight in diamonds
Plus I'll make you die man

Hook

Verse 2:
Killer technology I leave trails of bullet shells 
Like Hansel & Gretel did with the bread 
But except instead 
To get home I follow the path of the dead
Puttin' it back together like Smooth, E and Ray
Retarded kids are smarter kid I'm sick in the head
Christopher Reevein' was the way I was breed (he he)
Slidin' on fools like Jamaican bobsleds
Make rastas dread 
Grab heat from tool shed
And these are the straps that I manifest
I 'm waitin' to catch wreck on all you fuckin
 _____ mission at the continent
With the usual suspects that you can't neglect
Get real with or play chess
I take showers in my pants more luck than Irish
Why you jam like Tecs I'm taxin' like the IRS

Song:   Dear El-Pee
Typed by: URB magazine and rec.music.hip-hop

"Dear El-Pee,

How's your summer been? Mine's been fine. I heard you had a real good time at
camp. Oh, yeah, I talked Len, he said everything's cool. Oh, yo, I really liked
"End to End Burner"; that little diss me thing on the internet was pretty
funny. Yeah, it's live, sucker. Uh, yeah, and I was talking, y'know, trying to
sell my record distributors and they wouldn't take it because, you know, some
fat white kid was thinkin' it'd be funny to blackball. Well, you know, I wrote
a little poem about it and I really hope you like it. So have your mother read
it to you and if you guys like it, you can write me back!"

I'm a Anticon iconclast catalyst for cataclysm
Tell Fox: dissing Sole, bad executive decision
Your egosystem's frail, with a spoon I could dissect it
Soundin' like Corky got his nubs on a Webster's dictionary
A Ras Kass record and a brand new MPC
Pressing all them pretty buttons, making wack beats
To hell with Fat Beats, I'd rather rock acapella
I'd rather be broke and have a whole lot resent
Not a Rich King, a pawn, a peon for me to pee on
Check out 9th Street, a big sign: "El-Pee got served" in neon
Trendy indie underground cause you haven't got a choice
Take a way your elitist buddies and you haven't got a voice
No five thousand for radio, no hundred-thou for ads and banners
No paying record stores for all your Rawkus propaganda
Well-timed marketing scheme, it's cool to be independent
But if it was last year, you'd be a dun or a Missy Elliot
And after your indie bravado and the label has recouped
You're broker than when Libra left you crying for a record deal from Luke
I strike you awestruck, you femanine to blackball
I'll be serving you 'til you're serving me ice cream in a mall
Some fool said this an underground Canibus and LL
Well that's comedy, cause I'll serve all three of y'all
Heard Rupert had to starve all the indie artists to feed your ego 
Running around the Bay looking for Sole with your foot in your mouth
I heard you like the Bay (Castro) but think 4 tracks are wack
Lost in the Ozone and all your mixdowns sound like crap
Hiding lack of intellect behind hipster catch phrase and babble 
Indellibles'll never get a full length cause you don't wanna be outshined
Fine, I heard you wanna kill me and get fools after me  
The only violence you ever witnessed was on Menace II Society
Try to sound deep and got masses fooled by your lack of rhythm
I elevate while you perpetuate your malopropism

[Yo, wha, what did he just call me, dun?]
Yo, I don't know, man. Yo, I, I don't know what he just called you, man.
[Well, yo, go get the books. Go get the Bible.]
Yo, man, well apparently you must've ripped all the pages out in the
dictionary, man, cause you've used all the words.
[So I'm never gonna find out what he called me? He's usin' big words against
me? Yo, this is intrepid, god!]

I'm a hip hop artist, you style-biting MC sucker
Had a Crayon contest with retarted kids and picked the wackest album cover
Picked the wrong MC to diss subliminally, every line dissected
Yeah, I diss you on the internet, to your face, and on record
For the record, I know the muck from which out you have stepped
First you sound like Beatnuts then you're Mr. 4,000 syllables 
One bar, out of breath on stage a failure
Gotta quit rocking mics and start rocking an asthma inhaler
El-Producto: indepenent as Fox
Since when do indie records show up in a WEA box?
By saying you're indepenent you belittle the whole movement
Real MCs work hard, ain't got investors to put out their music
Underground conspiracy but this ain't used by No Limit
Mad cause you didn't blow up, the victim of your own wack gimmick
But some fools bought into it cause they don't know no better
That you're a hamburger pimp, only out for the cheddar
Yo, what's a battle MC that can't freestyle?
All these references to imaginary MCs, come battle me
Remember in Boston, you started calling fools out?
And when MCs try to battle, you were the first to break out
Well, you surely don't wanna battle, of course you want to fight, you're bigger
Fine, you win, we can have a contest to see who's the biggest wigger
Oh, you win again, it must feel great, I heard you don't like white MCs
Traded in your Kani and X hats for a fresh set of Echo and Adidas
You as hip hop as Garth Brooks and as manly as garter belts
And if you're so creative talk about something other than yourself
No, I'm not dissing New York or any of your comrads in arms
I'm tearing down that posterboy Miss Piggy-lookin' leprachaun
El-Pee vs. the Spice Girls (I got five on Scary Spice)
But both of y'all are in desperate need of back up singers when it's live
And I know they think your original, but follow me through this portal
You bit your whole styles from an underground MC named Vordul
Spread rumors about me to everyone you meet, evade being a man
I heard you putting out an instumental album of sitars, pots, and pans
You've done enough talking, so I know you ain't fading Sole
Have your boy Rupert Murdoch fly you out, I'll serve you on the Wake Up Show
The redheaded kingpin, step child to a little herpe sore festering
Heard you only pull females when you tell 'em you're a lesbian
Wanna sign autographs, but all your fans are rappers
The evolution will not be televised as your #1 fan becomes your master
I'd love to give you a hand but all I got is a middle finger
Farakhan won't squash this, so we can finish it on Jerry Springer
Newsweek martyr, bring your rhetoric retort
You oughta tootsie roll under your rock, your two minutes of fame got cut short
FYI: starving artists don't have corporate luncheons
Got a horrible freeestyle and the rest of your style is (studio punch-ins)
The dun crusher busts fresh, overly when I blast 'em
And those so called freestyles, they all popped up on your album
Manipulate your connects so they wanna see me on a curb
But I guarantee you lyin', cause you know one-on-one you'd get served
Now it's time to pay dues like when Daddy Warbucks 
Bought your face onto the cover of the last Stress
We gonna battle, so write your rhymes ahead of time
And I'll still come twice as fresh
And keep it all in the family, like Rose I'll take a back seat
Keep my name out your mouth like my wax from the racks of (Fat Beats)
Fat egos inflated, hope you liked my little poem
And hope to hear from you soon, signed, your friend, Sole

Chorus:

The greatest thing in this world is life
And life is full of pain struggle and strife
Decisions and moves you make gotta be precise
Step careful son watch how you roll your dice

The greatest thing in this world is life
And life is full of pain struggle and strife
Decisions and moves you make gotta be precise
Thinkin that you the man and you might see ice
and that ain't nice

(it's like that and uh
 it's like that and uh)

Verse One: Pharoahe Monch

Never exceeding my recommended dosage
When it comes to licking, selecting, chicken
It's never what it seems when you're picking
Cause you can't tell from the eyes
Especially now they seperate the legs from the wings and thighs
ain't no surprise in it
You get it, with, cellophane wrapped tight over the meat
they be like disguising it
I'm sort of sticking to my old ways (true)
Keeping my order score the chicken dark nowadays
Even believing in retrieving in my own chicks
It's, no need to be rude (shit)
I let the butcher chop it up and key food
And hit her with the keys if she's On Bended Knee like Boyz II Men
I tell her I don't want to catch some vanilla poisoning
I'm poised and when... it's the opportune time
before I stuff my face
Kneel my head over my plate, then I say my grace
Pray up above
Slip on my rubber glove and dine
Polish off the meal and enjoy some wine
Relax recline
Yeah

Chorus

Verse Two: Prince Poetry

Aiyyo most def, you know I love, gettin it on
(but not without the stretch)
Don't need to be making that three letter catch (cool)
Careful who I choose to make ooohs
Better believe me love (we living in the paradise of fools)

Yo Pharoahe (right?) Remember I met Yvette in Dallas, Tex
(That cool queen long blonde chick with mad connects?  No quest)
Oh yes, she hooked hooked us to the game cuz strange shit
was going down in town
There was a pretty dear packin pound cakes
a cocoa butter babe with papes jewels a black Ac
and mad niggaz was liking that
Players tricking on that chicken and slippin
and never to go far; cause Shante had the scar
Now everybody knew why motherfuckers started droppin
But nobody knew Shante's ex-husband, was needle poppin
And on the other side of town, medical records was lost
Blood samples was crossed and doctor's mix-ups was found
Yvette said, "The six o'clock news covered the scam"
Three families blew the fuze
It was a psycho doctor at hand and insanity rules
Only two to lay five on that man, and he's singin the blues
He sings the blues, he sings the blues

We're living in the world of frus... tration plus
the lies lust gluttony and mistrust
Situations we discuss about world domination reflect...
...guns money greed and sex it all connects like a puzzle
In the game of life, in the game, in the game of life
In the game, in the game of life

The greatest thing in this world is life
And life is full of pain struggle and strife
Decisions

The greatest thing in this world is life
And life is full of pain struggle and strife

Song:   Deep End
Typed by: hknight@geocities.com

[Prevail]
What begins with an 'a' and ends with asphyxia?
Me, Prev One, the microphone cripple
A life on the edge of the walking dead
You either talk in black or you speak in red
I can't help you if you don't have the language down
It's either sink or swim and the average drown
Some of us stay afloat and respect the wave
With your mouth full of sand, burnt by sunrays
Five Ways to Sunday, A Fistfull of Dollars
A barrel full of commerece, blasting the somber
We always stand guard over the late shift
The cause and effect of the light and the mist
In the world of mixtapes and other sick breaks,
I spit like my life depends on what I make

CHORUS:
Working late night, not that we hate light
Just feels right, that's when tracks come out tight
Thoughts start creeping, people are sleeping
Pull words out of the dreams, it's the deep end
It's the deep end, people are sleeping
Pull words out of the dreams, it's the deep end
Keep in mind, it's not that we hate light
Just feels right, that's when tracks come out tight

[Mad Child]
Hand to hand combat, gone far beyond that
Armed to the teeth, this is a bomb threat
Graveyard shift, way past abnoxious
We play to win, you count your losses
An awesome roster, original designed rhymes find time
To make the shiver up your spine climb
This ain't theatrics, we rock with tactics
Smash on you plastic actresses for practice
The fact is I'm violent by nature, don't hate ya
Like most people about as much as they like me
Haven't found a way to say "fuck you" politely
These days I stick to myself, but sometimes get sick of myself
Got my own circle, love my people, bleed for my people
Need no replacement, Mad Child's life unfolds with bold statements

CHORUS:
Working late night, not that we hate light
Just feels right, that's when tracks come out tight
Thoughts start creeping, people are sleeping
Pull words out of the dreams, it's the deep end
It's the deep end, people are sleeping
Pull words out of the dreams, it's the deep end
Keep in mind, it's not that we hate light
Just feels right, that's when tracks come out tight

[Mad Child]
I'm not a vampire but I'm walking on a fine line
over fire-type rope, barefoot on barbed wire

[Prevail]
I'm not a werewolf but I force my fangs into the townfolk
Drain a little cowpoke until the city's bloodsoaked

[Mad Child]
I'm not a hoblin, a goblin, a ghost, or ghoul
Swollen Members ain't fuckin' with most you fools

[Prevail]
I'm not a phantom, a banshee, a witch, or an ogre
But my crew's got the best chance of taking over

[Mad Child]
Yo, I don't transform and I don't change shape
Don't take the bus, don't shoplift tapes
But I used to, and if you choose to,
Here's something to pop inside your walkman and cruise to

[Prevail]
I'mma pay dues and blues, that's the truth
If there's one thing I've learned from life, there's much to lose
I know, that's why we never duplicate shows
You're just an imitation, you can die like white buffalo

CHORUS:
Working late night, not that we hate light
Just feels right, that's when tracks come out tight
Thoughts start creeping, people are sleeping
Pull words out of the dreams, it's the deep end
It's the deep end, people are sleeping
Pull words out of the dreams, it's the deep end
Keep in mind, it's not that we hate light
Just feels right, that's when tracks come out tight

[Down]
Ah yeah
Everybody be calling us eses
What is an ese?
Do you know what an ese is?
Well, lay back
I'm about to let you know
I'm a take you on a lil' ride
Yo, check this out
This is the definition of a real ese

Chorus: Diamonique
Started in the west, somos Mexicanos
Everywhere you go, you gon' see Chicanos
Ball-headed, sleep, then ride in the lo-lo's
Ballin' so slow, gettin' down like the volos
An ese
Yeah-y-yeah-yeah
If you didn't know, now you know
The definition of an ese
Hey
What is it, what is it
What is it, what is it

(Verse 1)
The definition of an ese
Straight up cholo
Mexican hoods
Ballin' in the low-low
The definition of an ese
Creased-up Khakis
Nike Cortez's and white-tees
A ese
Tu sabes, a ball-headed loco
Hard as steel, growing up in the barrio
Got chrome D's in my
My sies-quarto
Now they're lowriding everywhere like a vato
The boulevard full of bad mamacitas
Probably got a oldie jam, playing out the speakers
He's a gangsta
An Aztec warrior
Brown and proud, always hold it down for his culture
Raza, homey
Aztlan represento
Hablando Spanglish
Escucha mi lingo
It all started en la costa oeste
And that's the definition of a real ese

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 2)
Got the O.G. Pachuco with the gangsta twist
Got the Ben Davis suit with the creases crisp
An ese
Don Juan with the ladies
Lay 'em in the cama til dawn, making babies
He gotta hustle for the cash, gotta feed familia
Mess around where the stash, she'll be quick to deal ya
An ese
Mexican-American
Puro Chicano
With stripes like a veteran
Sleeve down, tattoos tell his life story
Tag a set on the wall, that's his only glory
Cause mama prays to the Virgin Mary
She's worried
Because he's down to do anything necessary
Got enemies all around him
Plus the jura
Hasta la vista
A trip to la pinta
Known around the world as the hardest of gente
And now you know the definition of an ese

Repeat Chorus

[Down]
Yeah
And there you have it
Coming to you from the brown superhero
Write that one down in the dictionary, homie
Cause that right there
Was the definition of a ese
Straight up
Down, homie
A.K.A. Kilo
Straight up, straight down, brown, proud
Yeah

Instead of takin chances, I'm bein truth advances
Sometimes snappin bitches turns into slappin (STRESS!)
In the club, see there ain't no love lost
for those steady lookin for that rub-a-dub (This, is, Ab, normal)
Some only in it for the money
Fuckin two-headed dog on the prowl, hear the GROWL-OWL!
In the world turned upside down
A paralytical, now stick around with a frown
What is a beef? Beats the hell out of me
Flippin thangs to swang, neither here or neither there, yo
It's what they hear as a man, the murder music
Interpretation, invented the script, who isn't Nations (This, is, Ab,
normal)
A back lash hit the black fast
The straw monsters will pursue to find out what a nigga wrote
But pull my people for a track
Look forward to the black reparations for us to get the money back
Cracked in the back, don't give me no stress
Gonna make you accountable, your crime is surmountable
A full chick without chicken, just sucker you can stick it
where the sun don't shine to kiss the back o' mine

Don't give me no stress, hahahahaha

Crack ya in the back, don't give me no stress, hahahahahaha

Yo Chuck it's time for rip down, block lyrics get chopped vicious
My flow position like their waistline shiftin
Ain't nuttin different, y'all pit fall, the dungeon
Witness the drama comin focus splungin, finishin, where's the lungs?
Send a swifter hurricane, frozen dope vein wicked
Minds get lifted like the cross nails is broke off
Ya flippin once it's slow court, the street talks, we eat back
with poison on the track, can't avoid that, rhythm we bring noise at 
(Bring the noise) This chapter son is Melquan's scripture
Vision adrift, the mind kid is blinded, but rhymes be on a science climate

[Chuck D] Here he is, BAM
	    My man Son Slaughter bout to slam

proper, the planet rocker
My brain fluid vodka, lyrics influence the proper membrane
My first begin blended with strength vain to strike earth
My mic work wonder, soul with thunder
The Son Slaughter mission will finish script
strictly number number number number

Crack ya in the back, don't give me no stress, hahahahahaha

The most amazing, rhyme blazing, smoke that purple haze and
I'm the Ol' Dirt McGazing
After the club, I'm straight up dazing
I fuck til my nuts shiver up like raisins
Everybody just, do my dance
While your girl, she feel my dick through her pants
I'm the Ol' rotten slang, that Wu-Tang mixture
Leave your head to bang, boom bang licked up
Watch the speaker kick up, bitch eat my dick up
Ass stick up, I'mma hit her quicker
Never find a nigga nasty as Dirty
Still fuck a bitch if her ass is dirty
Still sip the Hennessey if the glass is dirty
You ain't getting shit if your cash ain't dirty

Hit a ho, make her go crazy
Doctor, doctor, she having a baby

(Girl: you crazy) What you say that for?
Bar slick with the gift of gab, I throw jabs

Still got a slab of that welfare cheese
Still get features from government G's
Still looking for a big butt to squeeze

Besides he don't even think his location is hot
He feel he got so much love no one would rat on his spot
That was a weakness, he should've neva had it from tha start
How tha fuck you gone be out here not playin it smart
He had a fire connection that broke him off wit tha bricks
Didn't matter if he finshed it, he sold all his shit
He talked out all his business so everybody knowin him
Niggas that's try'n to get em, tha same niggas be scorin
But round here people learn to keep they mouth shut
Dippin in niggas business will get yo house shot up
Now wodie got a nigga try'n bust his head open
He already scopin em, he know where he put tha dope in
Hopin that they could get him, cuz they had a knife
Lil One ya betta slow down cuz you ain't playin it right

(Turk)
Nothin but killas where I stay
Bricks and hallways
Real niggas in troops wit soljas who tote K's
Niggas that ain't scared to bust yo head dawg
Come at ya when they get greedy and let ya have it all
Niggas that's bout war and will beef at any hour
No matter tha weather hot or cold, leave a nigga sour
Hop out tha Eddie Bow, un-disguised wit no maskes
Leave tha scene drastic, catch ya while you in traffic
No grins or no laughin
Want beef?  
Then let's beef, tear down streets tear down streets
You wanna creep?
Then let's creep, in that UPT you got guerillas that's untamed
3 to that 13th, niggas that ain't playin

That's why I keep my chopper wit me at all times
Ready for war, spin a nigga block full of raw

"While you're squakin' I'll be chillin' like a vulcan" (x6)

Look who's disgusted to tell of a relationship just drag
Life's a drag Excessions for a drag I'm down to rags
And breaks from my old cassette tape
My boomer box filled with this for the audio rate
Ain't nothin' greater then some shakable bubonic
My jams the chronic
Suggestive the whole mind state is pure agressional best infession
Baby you and me can get  down
My boogie live my family jive with the woofer and down aaaye!
I explore rappin' within the groove I make things happen 
And ask when I critique myself to rappin' beats
I sign my strength get to length 
Then pray apon the weak I'm absolete
Without brew I just don't know what to do
A soul mystifiers on bound action like the truth
My baby boo thinks stack I got my tootsie roll on hold
Weak to the nareic known as Sugar Baby 
MC's back up yeah yeah as this plaque unfolds
 1-2 I'm disgusted like that. 1-2 Down to Earth is disgusted like that
1-2 I'm disgusted like that. 1-2 In every sense of the word
"While your squakin I'll be chillin like a vulcan" (x 4)

Check it now baby listen, I'll remain sane within my restrictions 
So much heat in my kitchen Ikeep the arrogent just bitchin 
My back sternI learn so many suckers carry shanks 
Before you can blink your feelin the insertion of the break 
I'm head overdue the world and it's ways 
I except fake like most MC's except props 
And now I'm thinkin', I'm thinking of relationships
No thanks for your help Down 2 Earth is at self
Now baby bust it
Why you have to leave me so disgusted
The thought of having to leave reinfested
Our love was thick but in the end you be the diz
My name is Eric and I'm sure you won't forget it
For now I have to leave you with a pound and some distance
No reminising this is far for me to get you in
So I've been feusin; baby you and me ain't down
1-2 mic checkin' as I leave you with this question

Hook (x4)

The frustrated far from fasinated 
Between the lust and the hated portrier of your avment
From a lover to a hater all that matters 
Is that the Eath makes splatters
Mission mode stop the presses, the pressure is depression
No depression just boredom
Stop naggin' me, attitude antagastige
My boots are knockin' but my door is locked
I got some force to crack a fills and plus a jung on the track
Hip hop should never front on me
back to whom it my concern form the pleasure to terror
Inbetween a rock and a pillow 
Too bored to stay awake but I can't get caught sleepin'
I must of slept no regrets I ddin't slip sleep slumbers
No time to get involved pick a number

Paradise of fools {*scratches*}

[Alias]
My frustration aimed at what I created has me feeling discombobulated
I hated the boredom so I reinstated entertainment from a well being
I'm seeing I made the wrong decision
My project had appeared easy but had no direction and precision
Beginners luck, only up to recent times do I feel stuck
I'm the only one to blame for things that ran amuck
I build up a universe that is now building me you see
Technological advancement is the creator now
And all things to be decided
When they not even once touched my hands
My quote unquote followers still constantly fill the stands on the so-called seventh day
For years it's been this way 
But these people can't figure out whether it's the first or last day to pray
They seem to think that I'm forgiving of all
Which means they have a scapegoat, if they happen to drop the ball
I've been called various names
None of which to me are flattering
They look to me for guidance but to me they do not matter
In my eyes, there's nothing I can do to help their situation
When they have internal conflicts with their whole congregation 
They gather every week and speak of me in songs
These beings I created in this project gone terribly wrong

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
You all claim that you know me 
But you really don't ever forgiving you say of me
In reality I really won't
From the day I gave you life to your last annointment
You have all been nothing but divine disappointment

[Alias]
So now I'm stuck to figure out what I should do at this point in time
These creatures think that there's an afterlife
So they spend their whole life benign
They killed another creature years ago that claimed to be my son
So now they mold their lives after him and claim that He's the One
the one that will save them and lead them to a new breath
I hate to break it to them... (I have nothing for you after death)
So carry on if you wish unknowing, thinking breath is wind blowing
Magnifying light bulb is the sun and tears a rivers flowing
Think that every bad thing that happens to you is at my will
Like bankruptcy, adultery and the reason why others kill
Go on and be misled as you have your entire life
You think that I'll somehow reward you for all your pain and strife
I can't control destiny, where'd you come up with that notion
(There's no cure for AIDS) so don't even bother with that potion
I didn't create the disease to punish others, I didn't even make it
So if you have that frame of mind you go ahead and break it
I'm sick and tired of feeling responsibility for all of you ungratefuls
Unwilling to share with the starving while you enjoying off your plateful's
Even if I had the power to help you I wouldn't even bother
So stop thinking that I love you and stop calling me your Father
I didn't plan on you evolving into this mess with which I deal
Asking for my forgiveness when you (lie, cheat and steal)
What the hell do you want me to do? Try and save yourself
I can't help your marriage, children or status of health 
My problem's far away, any of your so-called devastations
Like this oncoming war between the so-called United Nations
I regret making all of you, you make my blood pressure climb
I wish I didn't make you, but even I can't turn back the hands of time

Typed by: multsanta@home.com

...in once upon a times where babies are born into numerical order
there are things like hip hop and dead people
we just need to talk for two minutes...

There will be no
self respecting savior with completely comfortable skin
a new rap radio
hell, he or she might not have any idea what so
ever they got the good stuff in 'em
and I hate to cliché it, yo
but can you feel the pain, for real, though
ain't a grieving face hidden, just look at that building
women, a tortured ho willed to fit in clothes
and then remain accessibly loyal to the swift punch in the nose
so, where's my reinventors with the truth serum
and newfounders of the fountain of youth?
yet you awoke to obsess with their appearance
and desperately in need of some proof
man, holding hands saves lives
but we're in this one together whether the roof is on fire
or perfect for watching the other stars fry
and I know, I know cardinals and blue jays can't just get along
but, um, but their minds are the size of very small rocks
and we've the opposable thumb
not to mention emotions that can paint the walls of a cave
plenty big enough brains
so give it up, the debut hatch
then make like a dream and catch
there's an entire universe going on and you're invited
tell a friend

after all, change wasn't built for a day
and the first time you lay your eyes on something truly beautiful
it tends to stay that way

great people do great things and this next part is on you

and after all, change wasn't built for a day
and the first time you lay your eyes on something truly beautiful
it tends to stay that way

if different is all that we got that makes similar words crying out for
with ??? a voice and the precedent doesn't get any better than
easily ??

[Intro: Killa Sha]
Ayo man, come here to tell ya'll one thang man
(ya'know?), God do his thang man, (kildren, 2-5, AMK)
ya'mean? it's all serious like that understandin
(it's all of this, to shot illuminati)

[Verse 1]
Lay back God I am llumina one of the best
Kildren general at the top of the list
Mr. Hiss spit out for your slow gas niggaz
Talk too fast niggaz, blastin bash niggaz
I speak tunes infinite, savage ass niggaz
get affended cuz they crew ain't wit it
stop frontin and new wit it, ain't approve wit
move wit it dawg so Reeko could pass it on
I hover from storm, when I feel it the beef is on
Cancel wit my trustee and the kildren of corn
Jump on the horn two, five guns is long
It's real trust me dawg this just ain't song
I pound bangin bitches out in thongs
Have 'em ridin on the strip screamin, "who the fuck you wit"
I know you love the shit I bring (uh huh)
But fall back love let me do my thang, I do my thang

[Hook: Killa Sha] **repeat 2X**
To all your thug ass niggaz -- ya'll know I do my thang
To your foul ass bitches -- ya'll know I do my thang
To your fake ass niggaz -- ya'll know I do my thang
To your trife ass hoes -- ya'll know I do my thang

[Verse 2]
You see the type of nigga I am -- anti-social
Stay in the corner wit mine like I'm suppose to
If I don't speak - that means I ain't feelin you
And if you ain't god - shit I can't bail wit you
So don't press up, niggaz like you get messed up
All my kildren lie in the cut
so when you see me in an event, bent you know I got that thang
And I do my thang, my chain bling
I dare who-to press this king
cuz I stay on some scene shit like bang-bang
You even got bitches to bang and sling kane
You bangin kane in the six-four sittin on dames
You can catch me in the shade to the brains
Wit the 12 gage on the dash board for the game
So I do my thang

[Hook: Killa Sha] **repeat 2X**

[Verse 3]
Yo, so from here for foul ya'll know what I rep
Ya'll know the set, respect par' nuff for less
Like chess its a check so don't place your bet
Dry ass niggaz get wet or pipe press to the neck
Lil man's not known for being frail it ain't hard to tell
I hold weight on the scale
Through the valley of death I fear no evil
Theres no equal, when its on there’s no sequal
peeps to my peoples who know who I am
Shot illuminati the god the holy man
Control the world wit his hands honesty's the plan
First we scan the million ya' see who I am
God sended knowledge man, at the parliament
World toleranced, illuminati off, the written words
From me to you, plain view, when I riped off
Respect duke, do my thang

Typed by: janis@betatesters.com

[Eightball]
Yeah, we back again, baby
E'body wanna do what a playa do
But e'body can't do what a playa do
You know what I'm talking 'bout
Dre, Dre these fools wanna talk down on the playa man

[Andre]	Uh huh, uh huh
[Eight]	You know
	They don't know what I'm talking 'bout, though

[Andre]
Eh eh, tell them 'bout everything 
And how you're spose' to change
When you get a little paper, huh?

[Eight]	Yeah, yeah man
[Andre]	Can't do that, not the real playa's
[Eight]	They hardly ever met a real playas
[Andre]	Space age for ya'll
	That's all, just a little bit of that space age
[Eight]	Yeah did you get that?
[Andre]	Ya'll that was it
[Eight] Dre and Eight, Suave House

[Eightball]
Dig this, I hit the track with unbelievable raps
Fadin' oncomers with that unconceivable crap
We the tip-top playa's flipping real hip-hop
In the drop top we all ballin' non-stop
To the head baby, we keep (*edited*) don't trip
Think it over baby we toss (*edited*) so don't slip

[Andre]
Hold it down, Ball

[Eight]
Yeah, Dre, we gotta come real
Let the whole damn world know the whole damn deal
From the mic to the backey to the D-A-3
Eight gotta represent that S-U-A-V-E
D-R-E, chiefin' like a K-C chief
We're the pitter pair, we complete d-mix beats, uh

1 - 	Now everybody wanna do what a playa do
	But everybody can't do what a playa do
	I see you playa
	All in the mix right
	I see you playa
	Yeah, I got my shit tight

	Now everybody wanna do what a playa do
	But everybody can't do what a playa do
	I see you playa
	All in the mix right
	I see you playa
	Yeah, I got my shit tight

[Andre]
From Hummers to a house 
Watching the chief's blow 'em out 
In between Arrowhead and Suave House no doubt
From a playa to a southern play
Ain't no competition 
When our opposition think we slippin
But I ain't trippin'
Catch a plane, switchin' trucks Coup's and Lex
Tone paper stacks, bustin' rhymes with Eight on tracks
Ain't no holdin' us back, doin' our thing on this hip-hop scene
For whatever it's worth, mamma raised me since birth
To shake the earth and be a playa from the streets to the field
And everytime I touch the mic give 'em something they can feel
Like (*edited*) fantasies coming real in this battlefield
I know you wanna do me but she do too
Everybody can't do what a playa do

[Eight]
That's right, they can't do what a playa do
Big wild and Dre, floppin' this sign, it's on you Chiefs 
Ya knowumsaying? Uh

Repeat 1

Don't let the glitter hit your eyes 
And think that we ain't (*edited*)
I was running (*edited*) before (*edited*) knew I could rap
Railroad tracks, the fourty eight tracks and plats'
God blessed me with the knack to hear a track and react
South style, get buck and make the crowd get wild
Livin in a strange universe, real life x-files
Rock bottom from the gutter to a well known brotha
Clipped up (*edited*) with the flow, straight butta
What up, paper lova, chip gripper, scale tippa'
Verse bitta', flow flippa'
Nobody knows what my twisted mind holds
Mathematics and tactics for platinum flow's, uh

Repeat 1

Yeah, you can't do what a playa do
Suave House style, baby
Space Age forever
Eightball and Fat Man
Do Dre, and every deals

Repeat 1 until fade

Y'knowI'msayin?
Went from handcuffin hoes, to just fuckin the bitches haha
Lil' Chris, yeah, check it out though

Now I'm suited and booted, it's just another hot day
Rollin around on a Brougham mackin to this bitch' way
who I been tryin ta fuck since the ninth grade
Now she's on the phone cos she knows a nigga's paid
The big payoff, I'm bout to pay this bitch back
Get her fucked up and then I'ma kill her cat from the back
Cos I be showin no mercy to the cock
I'm bout to raid this motherfucker like it was a spot
So I tell a bitch, "Meet me at the mall
I be in the cut, callin ???? where they're sllin basketball"
So I meet fate, ain't even no competition
I'm already fuckin his bitch on the flo' in the kitchen
When it comes to the pussy like Michael (ooh yeah) I'm Bad
The bitch was cool, I know the cock was mad
She said "There is it cool?", yeah baby don't trip no doubt
then I told the bitch (BEEITCH) get the fuck out!

Chorus:

We don't love em', we don't need em'
We don't love em', we don't need em'
We don't love em', we don't need em'
"Break your shit and get up"
*repeat*

I gets a page from the homegirl Yvonne
Not just a homegirl but a freak in heat, like the sun
I want to call her off so I axed "What's poppin?
She want me to come over and have her fuckin room locked
It's like a track, nigga cos I run a race to the ho
But before I fucked her axed the bitch for some doe
So she paid me (I fucked her), then she laid me (I stuck her)
When she touched my ass (Mistake that bitch for a buster)
It happened so fast, don't remember what I saw
Bitch in the kitchen holdin an icepad on her drawers
My fault, y'know how it gets in that situation
Playin with these bitch' minds like some PlayStation
I heard the do' knocked then I looked at the ho
A nigga bout 7 feet, standin in the do'
So I threw the bitch across and cold knocked his ass out
Then I slid on my shit and I was out that bitch house

Chorus

It's '9-9, that's the way I see these hoes
I'm not buyin dem jewelery and brand new clothes
Fuck the dumb shit, it's time to get rich
And later on get a woman I wouldn't call a bitch
But for now, that's what I'm livin for
and favorite words to a bitch, is "Fuck a ho!"
But once again it's on with this bitch named Miss Dick
Holdin nuts in her mouth like some fuckin biscuits
Cos she say they melt in her mouth, not in her hand
That's the type of shit that makes me a one-night-stand man
Be bouncin on the cock, like I'm on switches
Huffin and puffin, fuckin and diggin up ditches
Girl went outta town, she went down south
In a town of unzipped jeans and dicks in her mouth
That's the shit I love to do everyday with a bitch
Fuck, get paid, then have em' dismissed

(D'Wayne - talking)
Mac Mall, and me, D, once again
I'ma send this one out nationwide, representin the bay
To all the ballas, all them ghetto stars
All the turfs and tracks and sets

(D)
Daddy was a hustler, uncle was a dealer
What was I supposed to be?
When everyone around me, is always makin money
Faster than ya eyes could see
Now you're actin funny, no more church on Sunday
At night you pray
Standin on the corner, bound to be a goner
And this is how it's gonna be

(Hook - D) 4x
In the dope game, dope game
(Be a star in the)

(Mac Mall)
It's goin out to all the local D-boys and track stars
Hustlin youngstas runnin up to cars
I know it's hard
I was once forced to hustle, too, like you
Pushin hard to the week souls who choose the glass tool
Over life, love and loot
Waste it all in one poof
Chasin clouds a smoke but really runnin from the truth
I see mothers abandon kids to go on drug ????
And even when I was all in I wondered when it would all end
Same sucka who passed the law
Pick the dope and though I talk
He come jack me when I'm posted on my block
For all those who sell rocks
White girl ??? yola
See the enemy ain't competition, all them crooked rollas
Cause man the White House, got us strung out, thas real talk
It's hittin playas on them streets that we walk
I say the White House, got us strung out, thas real talk
It's hittin playas on them streets that we walk

(Hook)

(D)
Now I want you all to understand
Fly things we all can have
But don't get it twisted
That don't make a man
Because if you don't respect yourself
Then you won't respect nobody else
And you will see what happens
Mac Mall speak on it

(Mac Mall)
Nigga wake up, the revolution callin us
It's life or death so don't ya be tardy
I try to tell 'em learn the planet of illuminati
But mothafuckas in the hood just wanna be Gotti
And catch bodies
Sell dope foreva but never raise his kids
And think it's fly to pull some time in the pen
I try to tell him that that New World Order is near
But off that product, he can't think clear
Either know, or either don't care
Nigga think he free, still got the slave mentality
Smokin on the way out
Runnin from reality
Do you believe in the Holy Trinity
All the profit, Muhammed, and pray to the East
I doubt it, cause you don't even know who you be
Just anotha blind nigga in a jungle a concrete
Do you realize the original man
Instead you rather be a dealer, a killer, a gangsta for satin
But he ain't tryna hear me, nigga scared a the truth
He lust for loot, and never once pray to Jesus
The government put arms in my hood like Babe Ruth
Young niggas kill each other like it ain't shit else to do
In the dope game

If you girl kneels down, and suck my dick
Gave a nigga head, and homie tried to choke her
But he didn't care, cause she ain't nothin' but a smoker
That's the way it go, that's the name of the game
Young niggaz gettin' over by slangin' caine
Lex around my wrist in 18K heaven
Bitches clockin' on my dick twenty four seven
Plus, I'm makin' money, keepin' baseheads waitin'
Roll the six four with old gold Daytons
Live in Inglewood, California, C.A.
This oozie up your ass if I don't get paid
Niggaz beggin' for credit, I'm knockin' out teeth
Clockin' much dollars on the first and fifteenth
Big wad of money, nothin' less than a twenty
Yo, you wanna whole chicken, Mack 10's got plenty
To be a dopeman, boy, you must qualify
Don't get high off your own supply
From a Key to a G, it's all about money
Ten piece for a ten, base pipe come free
If people out there not hip to the fact
If you see somebody gettin' money for crack
He's the...

[Chorus: Squeak Ru]
Dopeman, Dopeman (Mack front me a sack)
Dopeman, Dopeman (I'll get you back)
Dopeman, Dopeman (Tryin' to stack me a grip)
Dopeman, Dopeman (Man, fuck that shit)

[Mack 10]
You need a nigga with money, so you get a Dopeman
Juice that fool for as much as you can
She like his car, and he get with her
Got a black eye, cause the Dopeman hit her
Let that slide, and you pay it no mine
Find that he's slappin' you all the time
But that's okay, cause he's so rich
And you ain't nothin' but the Dopeman's bitch
Do what he say, and you keep your mouth shut
Talkin' that drag might get you fucked up
You sit and cry, if the Dopeman strikes you
He don't give a fuck, he got two just like you
There's another girl in the Dopeman's life
Not quite a bitch, but far from a wife
She called a Strawberry, and everyone knows..
Strawberry, Strawberry is the neighborhood whore
Do anything for a hit or two 
Give the bitch a rock, she fuck the whole damn crew
It might be your wife and it might make you sick
Come home and see her mouth on the Dopeman's dick
Strawberry, just look and you'll see her
But don't fuck around, she'll give you Gonorrhea
If people out there, not hip to the fact
Strawberry is a girl, sellin' pussy for crack
To the..

[Chorus: Squeak Ru]
Dopeman, Dopeman (From an ounce to a key)
Dopeman, Dopeman (Tryin' to get this chesse, man)
Dopeman, Dopeman (Cluckers ridin' my dick)
Dopeman, Dopeman (Man, fuck that shit)

[Mack 10]
If you smoke caine, you're a stupid motherfucker
Known around the hood as the school yard clucker
Doin' that crack with all the money you got
On your hands and knees searchin' for a piece of rock
Fiendin' for a hit, and you lookin' for more
Done stole a Alpine out of Wavy six four
Smokin' like a train and I wouldn't want to be you
Done took from the homies, better run, when I see you
Ballin' everyday, doin' more drug deals
Rollin' around town, on the twenty inch wheels
If people out there, not hip to the fact
if you see Mack 10, you can ask me for crack
I'm the...

[Chorus: Mack 10 W/ Minor variations]
Dopeman, Dopeman (Yeah, that's me)
Dopeman, Dopeman (From an ounce to a key)
Dopeman, Dopeman (Cluckin' much as I can)
Yo, fuck that shit, who am I?  
"The Dopeman"

[Outro: Squeak Ru Talking]
Mack 10 nigga, you must be slick
Put Squeak on the team, now we're stackin' chips
Good lookin' out, for showin' love
Now I got bitches on my dick cause I'm flossin' Dubs

[ * AKA Triggerman ]

( *siren sound, car tires screeching* )

The rhymes you are about to hear are true

MC's names have been changed to protect the innocent

(Drag Rap)

Our story starts in a town that was not tame
There was no laws, things were insane
In order to survive you had to be mean
Our story starts in notorious Queens
Two gangleaders bound to meet
The ultimate conclusion - one's defeat
They ruled their turf with an iron hand
Bugs Can Can and Filthy Triggerman (Triggerman)

Now I'm Bugs Can Can, there can none match
My sawed-off shotgun'll blow out yo chest
If Filthy Trigger comes my way
I'm gonna cut off his head and put it on display

Hold up ( ? ) don't you be so bold
Cause that trash that you're poppin, better put on hold
Cause I'm definitely comin, you know I don't lie
Remember Bugs, you used to run but you can't hide

(Drag Rap)

Alright boys, the plan goes this way
I wanna blow Triggerman back to yesterday
Nardo, I want you to go to his house
Ring his doorbell and punch his wife in her mouth
Drag her by the hair into the street
Tie a rope to the bumper, other end to her feet
Drag her with the car till day turns night
Oh and Nardo, give that broad a bad day (Alright)
Cut her off the car, throw her back in the yard
And tell her Bugs Can Can sends his regards

(Drag Rap)

Alright thugs, here's what we'll do
Red Money goes straight to you know who
Bugs Can Can, that heartless hound
And tell him that it's time that he leaves this town
On your way back bring me his son
Lock him in a trunk, yeah that should be fun
And so Bugs knows he has to lose
Have his son fitted for cement shoes
Then drag him from the river, throw him back in Bugs' yard
With a note around his neck sayin 'Triggerman's hard'

(Drag Rap)

Oh no, what happens next? For goodness' sake
So stay tuned till after this commercial break

( *beatboxing while tune from Old Spice commercial is whistled* )

Now this battle goes on for quite a while
Trigger's wife is hurt bad, Bugs loses a child
But nevertheless this contest of power
Is gettin more critical by the hour
With my ( ? ) Phillie blunt in my hand
Bugs Can said: It's time I dropped this man
Trigger fixes his grip, my last words were clear
I said: Boys, it's time to get busy out here
So we loaded up our limos with our gangland members
Some with Uzis in their hands ridin on the fender
Police was warned, they was under alert
Cause in a little while Hollis would be goin berzerk
Yes Hollis Queens was the place of this showdown
News traveled fast, it was like a ghosttown
Limos rolled up, the distance were safe
Bugs drew third, Trigger drew fifth place
Uzis pulled on, 9 milimeters cocked
In the air was the sirens of the lousy cops
Bugs Can Can said: That doesn't matter
Pulled on my Uzi and ratatatatata
Trigger yelled: Scatter, my posse dispersed
And the spray that went back was two times worse
Ratatatatatatata-boom!
The boom was a sawed-off ( ? ) assume
Bein held in the hands of Eliot Ness
Standin on the roof with a badge on his chest
He said: Alright boys, the law is here
So let's drop those weapons, put your hands in the air
What?! came out the mouth of Bugs Can Can
Put my hands in the air, who is this man?
Eliot Ness? Please, who is this?
When I paid off the force, was there someone I missed?
No, you couldn't be, arrestin me
I own your boss, your judges and any jury
I'm the one that rules, I'm in command
Somebody tell him who I am - Bugs Can Can
Now look Mr. Ness, you must be new
A flat-footed, pointy-ass, stink-punk screw
Cause Filthy Triggerman has one thing to say
You better get off that roof and be on your way
So don't waste your time arrestin me
Cause on your paycheck is signed 'Triggerman Filthy'
I'm above the law, so don't feel cheated
Mr. Ness, put a egg in your shoe and beat it (beat it)
(Drag Rap)
So with this in mind, yes, Ness did shout:
There'll be a tree standin where you are when you get out
And if anyone runs, your boots I'll cook 'em
Gave a smile to his boys and then said: Book 'em (book 'em)

I know I seen her in a magazine, but maybe I'm trippin
This drink got me slidin when I'm ridin then I'm sippin
Just made it to the club and already got some action
Maybe it's the candy 500 SL that got 'em reactin
Once you in girl you ain't gotta think about a drink

You and your partner, me and my cousin Ant Banks
We can do it live one time just so you will notice me

Drinks on me baby, all night

You can drink, get your double up, drink it up
Drink it up, baby girl, til you ready to fuck; (I said)

I got my Rolex glistenin and the bitches be whisperin
Ant Banks is gettin the pussy and they know I be listenin

Don't hate the player motherfucker hate the motherfuckin game

After two more of these drinks, shoot, that ass is mine

[Captain Save M']

Doin your duty, bumpin and grindin on ME, with your big-ass booty
Baby got me twisted, if she think it ain't all gravy

(Verse 1)
It's Loco, baby
Back at it
Got 'em hooked like
Crack addicts
Chop the herb with the
Craft-matic
The party's packed like
Bad traffic
We on the Ave.
V.I.P. clubs
P.J. thugs and three day runs
Throw your drinks up, don't spill it on the rug
Mama find out, we all kick the fuck out (Out...)
Bedford life like steriods and A.K.'s
Back in the day, used to buy shit on layaway
Loco came up in the rap game, what?
Buying trucks
Changing last names up
From Mr. Broke Ass to Mr. Mo' Cash
Don't laugh
Hoes used to roll past
Now they wanna team up, split my cream up
Put the beat up and throw your drink up
Pilots, go pilot
I'm wildin' out
Drinks in the air, freaks everywhere
From
Cali to Dally
Memphis to Texas
Boston to Slauston
Bossin' and flossin'

Repeat Chorus Twice

(Verse 2)
Throw your drinks up if you drunk or you faded
Tonight, we celebrate
Loco made it
From the swap meets, to the Mom and Pops
To rockin' hot beats
On top the yatz
Pop the fonzi, lyrical shit kicker
I mix liquor
Then I spit sicker
Guaranteed to hit with ya
Get with ya
You the small screen
I'm the big picture
Like IMAX
I write the fly raps
Save the wise cracks
I'm a ride that
Got this party crackin', like war in Iraq-n
Honies get macked when I'm, strapped for action
TG3 flashin'
New CD smashin'
Hundred thousand copies, sold, from when we go gold
Pimp Latino
Throw up your piston
Me so crazy like Vin Diesel, baby
You'se a chump, you don't wanna crush a hoe
We in the club huntin' (???) bubba low
Headed to the high end on the Sunset Strip
Residential suite
Come get ripped

Repeat Chorus Twice

Throw your drinks up if you feelin' alright

Throw your drinks up if you feelin' alright

[Solitair]
Yo take a stroll through my town
T-Dot's the name, T-Dot's the mainframe
Burn concrete plain, the city don't change
Straight crooks with bad looks
Straight cops and hot shots and, grams to cop
My resident don't stop, but a quote to ya
Roll thick to the skin, 'cause them ones don't grin
Showing fist to the tank cousin, that ain't sweet
Third rail, burn trail, Scarborough to Rexdale
Up north to the coast, we boast and toast
Telling tales of the most reboast, while smoking
Real cats ain't choking, but face they fears with no tears
Surround beef with bears, 'cause it's all the same though
We still running from po, 
but at least though some of us running with dough
I say a prayer for tomorrow to come, but will it?
Try to murder my soul with a silver bullet
I'm still fit to survive for these streets I cross
Tune into the T-Dot live, check it
I'm still fit to survive for these streets I cross
Tune into the T-Dot live, yo

CHORUS

[Saukrates]
From the street to the radio, yo
After all the years of blood and tears this hustle better pay me dough
Naw mean?  I seen too much
This industry got you gassed like a diesel truck
MCs who duck, spitting these rap grains insane
I put two in your brain so y'all remember the name
Drop the beat proper, street author, showstopper
I take a pause for enforce to off you with
These lyrics that I disassemble the corporate
And give these streets what they deserve to get
Yo, I push a herb to quit dough
Spit positive words that the T-ditto did
Don't take me lightly, I slide this uhh to your uhh
Still one with the poor, quick to stick the rich
The way my tongue's in your ear it's like porno flicks
Foreplay, I'm all day, always

CHORUS

[Michie Mee]
It just cut and cut true, the only thing we can do
Them bad boys wasn't wearing black they was wearing blue
Telling us we was bandulo when we band too
And they don't give a (what), they got a budget for you
Other can't sleep, don't weep, I bust like danger
No hills too steep, I just go faster
You want to go first, I stay close and go after
‘Cause what go up fast come down even faster
You ain't want to dis me but do what you have to
This is our life, and we're the masters
Mass appeal and only time we reveal
Backed by many yardies
Everybody know me in this party
Canibus called, but when it get hot everything drop
Who run campaigns for hip hop, it don't stop
You know the theme, let the plot be no secret
Better believe, it, if you cop it you better peep it

Looking at my Gucci it's about time
   "Check it, one time" {Bahamadia}

[Bahamadia]
As the clock keeps ticking in this hip hop shit
My main objective is to float way above the average
State of MCing by a thorough thought out elaborate
Speech reaching the multitude standing form of what I believe in
My all races of heaven for the one who's truth seeking
Be the vessel for messages so far without preaching
Before knowledge of self I walk through darkness like a heathen
Had a 3.5 GPA in ???? for teaching
Then my lust of words start giving life new meaning
Strengthen of my inner regions so my aura could be beaming
Fertilise my creation like ovaries to semen
Spit rhyme for reason, clinging to my up bringing
Spirit got to be that when I first pledge allegiance
Thus spawning the lessons in the song I be singing
Thus spawning the lessons in the song I be singing
I got for what I know to help the growth of human beings

CHORUS

[Frankie Ano]
I advertise like a poet, paint a picture when I flow it
Drop a gem on you then, all you party people know it
That I'm not a mere mortal, but extraordinary human
Amazing with the microphone, plus the music I be doing
Is I like, still the finest, like blue note jazz
Your royal highness, king poetic flavour of the rhyme list
I insist you close lips and pay homage
To me, Bahamadia and for the way we drop knowledge
Hot like peppermint, ultraviolet I spit
It's big like the bang theory, or when Adam start to spit
The champion, individually inspired son
Approach me with steady caution like the new millenium
Radiate, I see your eyes lit with grave concern
Recordable like CD-R when the shhh start to burn
Nowhere to run from when words sprung like volcanic ash
So somewhere in the future they can find you in the past

CHORUS

[Bahamadia]
Spit reality rap over this Frankenstein track
Recorded reported facts of an urban inhabitant
This is my, brain on wax, instead of mesculin or smack
Evade the ghetto death traps by using my thinking cap
Then drop, a gem and immortalise it
Any verse I use is a virtual patient
General thoughts so strong they linger on like a fragrance
Relate the folks from many walks of life and all ages
And all places and all stages, when all phases
Lend you a hand if your vision were ever jaded
For as the future cop me as one who try to save it
The impact of this music really ain't nothing to play with

[Frankie Ano]
See, I'm super fly paper, get you stuck on any subject
The hip hop president of this republic
I know you love it, don't fight it
Find peace before it fucks with your head, sort of like the Middle East
I break the lease and get bent on rappers to pay rent
Try to overthrow my government it ain't going to happen
I'm a real brother with a lasting impression
Forcing dedicated rappers to just quit their whole profession
No question on the mission verbal oral expedition
Wise words formulate the deadly verbal lyricism
I'm a Scorpio, but drop a gem on eyes
Stand clear from my dears is what I always advise
'Cause

Now the FBI monitors with no feedback
Saw me on the street, ask me where the weed at
or the coke I don't sell and yet I don't believe that
Set me up I'm runnin breathin like a Sleestak
Ran into a car and almost bent my knee back
It's better than a cell while my lawyer's fee stack
Ducked into a liquor store they ask what you do
Wearin FUBU it was my man N'Duku
The bat and tote go through, I said, "Merci beaucoup
If they ask who was I runnin tell the bastards I flew"
Maybe to my block, plans to catch a few flicks
Police did a sweep, terrorizin grue shit
Bustin doors, beatin mammas while makin Cool Whip
Face down, gettin dirt on my back to school fit
My neighbor that was next to me got black and blue lips
When the fuse lit, you don't see the few flip
Kick our boot up they ass and ask em if the shoe fit
Til then, they wanna see us pushin up tu-lips
Frisk my nuts so much, shit I think I'm sterile
Got up, brushed the gravel off my apparel
This girl Cheryl got parole violation
Said she was high cause of pupil dilation
If you never got arrested now since infinity
You get searched livin in this vicinity
or harassed, beat the shit out - I mean, the livin daylights
Wouldn't be no dope slangin if McDonald's paid right
They target areas of black, Chinese and Mexican
Mow you down men, or they'll find your next of kin
Whites sell more cocaine and amphetamines
but the justice sentence us, more than like to credit dem
The ruling class shifts dope to you and me
And don't get arrested, this is lunacy
or is it pimp low magic in unity
Is it a war on drugs, or just my community?

Now who gets paper and who gets perved?
Who gets slapped and who gets served?
Now this type of shit get on my last nerve
I think about it in the car and I start to swerve
Who gets paper and who gets perved?
Who gets slapped and who gets served?
Now this type of shit get on my last nerve
I think about it in the car and I start to swerve

I got a commonest plot to get the federales hot
So many cops around the block ?? Tupac
You gotta flake and two rocks, and tissues in the shoebox
Convincin after two knocks, who heard of fences in your socks?
Now this is for la gente, keep it calliente
Let's send the presidente on a one way trip to casa permanente
Not a teacher but a sensei
These rhymes are for battle plus you gotta get the rent paid
I bust the donut up in front of Wenchel's
Makin police state officials with fat bones
that's made of gristle test they torque to differential
Now it's essential, our problems ain't provincial
'fore a nurse call our bodies white chalk stencils
Broke as fuck, eatin lentils with no utensils
That type of struggle motivated my pencil
It ain't mental it's material
Police are the fist of the imperial, I'm spittin through your stereo
Babies need cereal, folks need currency
My job got a crowd wavin applications fervently
Some'll get accepted, most'll get rejected
Guess they gon' til the new prison get elected
and that'll solve they unemployment streak
They'll be makin microchips for two dollars a week
That's why they packin us in there in droves and fleets
And Channel Two gon' call it cleanin up the streets

Now who gets paper and who gets perved?
Who gets slapped and who gets served?
Now this type of shit get on my last nerve
I think about it in the car and I start to swerve
Who gets paper and who gets perved?
Who gets slapped and who gets served?

Song:   Dues
Typed by: nelly@itis.com

"Payin' dues" -Group Home

Verse 1:
My point of views through payin' dues
Using microphones set it off like the fuse in the Cipher zone
As I'm tellin' crews be gellin'
Rhymes blow your outter skeleton if your styles relevent
You know the flavor I gets deep like the grave
Headcracks I gave when tomahawk like a Brave
Now I'm paid in the trade like Special Ed Got It Made
Some conquer slave along the way sprayed like Raid
In 92 I spent my days in the YMCA
Freestyling while I cut the cross fade like a blade 
Stayed off the stage writting page after page
Now I blast like a guage twisting raps like braids
Laid stunts like I forgot, blunts got me all high
Hittin' stick after stick as I kick back
Acting like you run shit, rappin' all that dumb shit
You ain't the first one to brag about your fuckin' guns kid
Uzis and toolies they just don't impress
Whoole under the best bless let's my brain arrest stress
And that's the test act like you got a clue
If you're new on the set don't forget to pay dues

Hook:
"I pay dues" "We work hard" "Payin' dues" 
"I pay my dues and shit" - Guru (x4)

Verse 2:
Now I'm on the come up no need to run up with your gun up
From sun up to sun down I run sounds
The rap race is mad fucked up
MC's act stuck up but get they cars plugged cause they shit is butt
I bust rough cuts and never trust promoters at a show
They stack doe and try to stake me off the cash flow
Assholes be like "Yo know you got's to pay dues"
Fuck that I slay crews since days of 1982
You could never catch me empty handed at the mic stance
Understand I'm fed flippin' like tails and head
Born dead of the coffin known for droppin' non stoppin' schemes
Hit your spleen box and leave you fiendin' for oxygen
Rockin' 'em in Boston cause yo we ain't soft when I blow spots off
Then step collect my props and be out with the skins or punany 
Styles get deeper split the beaver 
Hit the cheeba sip a liter of Tequila
I need a break gettin' tired of makin' demo tapes
Wating for papes fills my mind state with hate
I create since the days of the Cameo fame
So don't come running up askin' about the dues I've paid

[Killer Mike]
(Screwed) PURPLE LABEL
So niggaz want to know the story
Why the label got changed from Aquemini to Purple Ribbon, shorty?
Where Dre at man? Why isn't him and Big on TV man
Them boys still down? Organized goin' through changes
All I know is that Big here, Dre gone, moved on
(Scratched) All I know that Big here, Dre gone, moved on
(Scratched) Big here, Dre gone, moved on
Changed names from Aquemini to Purple Rib-bon
My first album slept on, failed to do a mil
But yet and still, my babies haven't missed a meal
God damn, is there a curse on Dungeon Fam?
The Goodie Mob broke up, the DF album didn't jam
Before Lil Jon had the grill in his mouth
Khujo Goodie had the dreads with the grill in his mouth
And Bubba Sparxxx gave you the phrase new south
Like Cool Breeze gave you the phrase dirty south
Is it only me? Or does Pharrell sometimes remind niggaz of
Sleepy Brown back in '93?
I know its been like 12 Decembers (yeah, suttin' like that)
Let's remember "All the playas came from far and wide"
Yeah suttin' like that, talkin playalistic Cadillac
In the trap with +Two Dope Boyz+
Spittin Organized Noize via microphone
Do you believe The Source gave only gave 4 and a half microphones
They shoulda gave that a classic, ax Charlie Braxton
Damn man, I'm still amazed
The boys had the nerve to boo Big and Dre
When they hit the stage to accept the Source award
My heart dropped like a million other country boys
I thought my Mind was Playin Tricks like the Geto Boys
Damn man, I miss the interludes by Big Rube
He gave us knowledge that they wouldn't give us in school
So our mind wasn't so sick
Speakin' of being sick man I need a doctor
Which doctor?  Bring back the Witch Doctor
(Scratched) Feelin' me, bring back the Witch Doctor
Feelin' me, here's an interesting fact from me
When the boy Bobby V signed with DTP
He spit about blackberry molasses over Organized beats

[Chorus 1]
Late at night, early in the morning
Middle of the day, all day long

[Verse 1]
See us rollin', rollin' down the ave. on a sunny day
I'm at the picnic around the way
A page from Renee, so it's on after midnight
We quiet like church mice (Ice)
For the pookie, now missy wants to get with me
Flip with me, trick me, but when you dip with me
Slip with me ya lose grip with me
Now it's a given that other tricks with me, why

[Verse 2]
Girlie you're stouter than Guinness
Witness a young menace come wicked
Conversation had you possessed, obsessed
Now let me hit it, naw forget it
I'm raw with money to accommodate
Promise honey you just waiting, I got lust for you all day
Stay in my zone, territories I roam
A young G sprung easily for Gucci and chrome
Do me and I'm gone, it don't stop
Rockin' robins around the clock, check my spots
And then I'm out

[Chorus 2]
Late at night
Now we gets it on from dusk til dawn
Early in the morning
To my people in the streets when you need me it's on
Middle of the day
Proceed to act like G's, let the party last long
All day long
Life's a jungle, it's a struggle trying to get my hustle on

[Verse 3]
My ghetto reality has been draggin' me for twenty-four years
Here we go again, pullin' out my Benz let my friends and peers know
My life's in jeopardy, steadily scrillin' paper
Continous paper, high-powered cowards feelin' major
Now what's the flavor on your block, is every party non-stop
Did anybody make the news at ten o'clock
Still I got blues, let my suede shoes caress the streets
Avoiding the beats, request for peeps, yes indeed

[Verse 4]
Evil creeps with me as I slide through your block, the spot is hot
G-strings frequent, now let's pop the top
Poof, hit your projects and we dressed
We all family so need for a vest, less
Silk and lovely bubbly for everybody
The party's jumpin' the music's bumpin' now we slummin'
Late night, back streets be black street
Likes days, they ain't ready as we ball

[Chorus 2]

[Verse 5]
Every hour a baby's born crying, dying
Politicians lying, in the ghetto we surviving
I've been, throught the madness, sadness
My last view was of you in the casket

[Verse 6]
Stuck like magnets, evading haters cause they're scandalous
Dreams of lavish things, happily men turn kings
Burn trees, no more murdering third degree
Concerned it seems, the God watch over me

Chorus: Ese Daz
It, feels so, good, to
Be, alive
And I'm glad I made it
Everything is okay
Everything is alright
And after all I been, now I see the sunlight
So wake up, wake up
Get up, get up
Everything's gon' be alright
I just dust myself off, pop the sunroof top
And now I see sunshine

[Verse 1: Ese Daz]
I dig in the scene with a gangsta lean
Ahora was a good day, you know what I mean
I look up at the sky, only God can judge me
A smile on a face, cause I can care less what they say
So keep on
Talkin'
I'll keep
Stackin'
All my
Paper
Fuck all
Haters
But all the homies that got love for me
Just throw your dubs for me, represent with me
It's all brown love, when I'm in the club
I don't care where you from, let's just get all to rub
So Khool Aid and E-Dubb, won't you pop the bottle
While me and Lucky Luciano smoke a Cuban cigaro

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 2: Lucky Luciano]
Man, I wake up and ball, cause I been through it all
Used to have be my feet, now I 20-inch-crawl
Never had no money
Elbows as (As shit)
That's why I stunt now, put my game down flat (Shit)
Started at the bottom
Now I'm at the top
I'm all on your T.V., showin' off my rocks
Don't touch that dial
I'm on your station
I could drop a freestyle if you show me the paper
It, feels so, good
I'm doin' my thang, my situation is lovely
Some drastic change from Ole E to the bubbly
Used to blow on kareoke, now the radio love me

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 3: Ese Daz]
After all I been through, I can smile again
Sometimes, I pinch myself and count to ten
Cause it feels like a dream, nothing's going wrong
Nobody's diein'
No mothers cryin'
No ghetto chickens up makin' noise
And I'm surprised to see kids outside, playin' with toys
Huh
My Raiders won again, 28-10
And this club that I was (???) on my clothes, just let me in
Well, that's the goal, right, I see a mami lookin' tight
She walked up, "Ese, let's hook up
Later on tonight"
And now I'm feelin' I'm on top of the world
No more days, big and broke, strugglin' with, no hope
I'm just rollin' down Carson Street
With the top down, cruisin' to the H.A. streets
Huh
The cops didn't even pull me over today
Like Ice Cube
I had to say, "Today was a good day"

From LA to Japan gangster funk in my trunk 
Puffing on a joint in slump 
Slow Pain the pimp the player the O.G. 
Throw your hands up if you's a homie, don't you know me 
Chilling in a 64' Impala top dollar 
The big baller, concerts from coast to coast twenty grand 
Rockefeller pimp with the mike in my hand 
Pistol grip pump on my lap everyday 
Baler wear clothes cause I got to parley 
LA Dodgers normals on the mound 
Clowning info coco with that G sound 
Slowly bouncing up the street in my money lowride 
From the eastside to the westside

Slow Pain Chorus:
The eastside to the westside 
In my lowride 
Throwing up signs (Uh hu) 
The eastside to the westside

In my lowride 
Throwing up signs.

In my 80 thousand dollar low low

Filling fl-y homie wh-y try to lean to the left like I do 
Money that's my life so fool I'm staying true
G-Spot studios keep banging hits 
And  don't stop and it don't quit 
Can I get a hey for them hoes I left in LA

Homie were you from 
Homie what you need

Don't sleep on the worldwide westside 
The worldwide eastside 
The worldwide Lowride 
I mean the J-A-P-A-N lowrider mag in the SS rag 
Cacs on sag, twist a sig sag 
Walk around the stage with the 40 in the bag 
Ain't nothing popping but I party all the time 
Japan's got the money and the moneys all mine

And wave them all around like you just don't care 
On my cell phone, gots to call home
Tripping on this Benzo sitting on chrome 
Signing autographs taking thousands of pictures 
Counting in I'm getting richer 
Slow Pain t-shirts 
Slow Pain hats 
Slow Pain CD's pockets getting fat 
Still Saturday night Balling 
Rock the crowd so they all yes yallin 
Camcorder out backstage making movies 
Fine ass honeys calling out want to do me

(Talking)
Solitair, you know?
Nine eleven, S to the H to the A to the G y'all
This one's goin' out to all my peoples, you know what I'm sayin'?
One foot is in the street and one foot in the grave, you know what I'm sayin'?
We all know how easy it is to slip into that street life
Got no food on the table, nothin' to eat, this one's for y'all
 
(Verse 1)
I had a cousin named Derek, he hussled on the block
That nigga was a thug, I was not
14 years old, I watched him, he was the man that I wanted to be
And he was barely 16
He always had the shoes that I wanted to rock
And his moms didn't even know about the things he got
Gold chains, Nike Air Jordans, chicks on his jock
And it all seemed to come from bein' on the block, but
 
(Chorus)
It's so easy to slip
We sing a song of mercy for niggas that's caught in the struggle
It's so easy to faaallll
Cause the Devil's always tryin' to draw the kids into trouble
It's so easy to slip
We move like the sun over the ocean to see things clearer
It's so easy to faaallll
Feel like the only one checkin for you is the man in the mirror
 
(Verse 2)
I remember, he took me to the mall on a shopping spree
And bought the things my mom couldn't cop for me
He had my back till his last days, and now he's a ghost
That nigga taught me well, how the streets was hell
And a hussla's just a nigga that's tryin to make bail
A lot of dead niggas, even more in jail
Some even got a wife and a story to tell
How young blacks survive while living in hell, but
 
(Chorus)
 
It's so easy to slip
We got your back
It's so easy to faaallll
Y'all niggas ain't alone man
 
(Verse 3)
Drugs was apart of his life since he was born
His pops came home drunk and pissed on the lawn
And beat up his mom, and 'D' couldn't take it
His pops kicked him out of the house butt naked
He turned to his peeps, then turned to the streets
And turned his back on his screen filled sleeps
His pops passed away, but he never shed a tear
Like a self afiliated proficy, made himself clear
I grew watching him, we kicked it now and then
Sometimes I sit in wonder how life woulda been
If I had hussled with him, would I be dead too?
Was a bullet through the chest worth the shit he went through?
Fuck, I ain't a hussla, my cousin packed a gun
And his memories the reason I will never pack one
Niggas, stay alive, and to your peeps be true
Or the next rhyme in right might be about you, cause
 
(Chorus)-x2
 
It's so easy to slip, it's so easy to faaallll (fades out)

[Tha Realest]
I hit the murder scene, bringin matches and gasoline
I soaked the fuckin body scene, I'm gleam, heard em scream
I'm so sick when I dream of shit
Me and Swoop G on some Westside dolo shit
Murder for hire, bitch still peelin the baddest before
Ain't no soldiers takin orders, niggas bringin the noise
Release my frustration, my adversaries can't capture me
I do my dirt on the solo then hit the Pacific seas
So all I scream is "Nigga, fuck Chocolate Bandit" gleams, so understand it
I gave too much love to a nigga that's underhanded
If things go the way I planned it
I have this nigga's ass six feet deep and them Junior Nites stranded
Landed off a ghetto bird, I hit the hood
Give me love, nigga what's the word? I'm so absurd
It's easy bein a soldier, nigga fuck what they told ya
Murderin them bastards, no one lives to get older
It ain't easy

[Chorus: Tha Realest]
It's easy bein a soldier when there ain't no war
You niggas screamin ain't bitches but we know where they are
Who can I call in my time of need?
My real soldiers down to make you motherfuckers bleed, eternally
It's easy bein a soldier when there ain't no war
You niggas screamin as bitches but we know where they are
Who can I call in my time of need?
My real soldiers down to make you motherfuckers bleed, it's M.O.B.

[Swoop G]
We on some get money shit, robbin, duct tape ya like a mummy shit
Cocaine dealer shit, anything to get the money quick
Huh, we out for it, twenty bitches out-whore it
Ten of em married with kids but they niggas ain't knowin
Now she'd die for me, piece of the pie and hit the sky for me
Get on the stand, testify, the whole nine for me
Obviously I'm here to make this here my dynasty
Blast like I was in heat and shine like a dime piece
My girlfriend say I got a big ass dick
but two picks and razor blades is what I'm fuckin you with
I roll doe, forget where you from, to let the world know you a faker
Actor-slash-rapper-slash-studio gangsta
Don't make me take this rappin shit to another level
Have you niggas runnin scared, swearin I was the devil
When this is hell so there's no one for you to tell
It's easy bein a soldier til you hit the warfare

[Chorus]

[Lil' C-Style]
When I was young I use ta wanna be a drug dealer
Never had no dreams of bein no motherfuckin rapper nigga
A little youngster with a hard head
I wrote my first first rap with Snoop, talkin bout Half-Dead
That's why we X'd your bitch ass from The Pound
You know they talk about ya and ya still hang around
with the Death Row known gang, Snoop Dogg switched gangs
Talk about the Eastside, who be breakin rules, mayn
on how you do that dirt, witcha long hurt
Bang out dirt, but in the hood you straight skirt
Shiit, I'm on a low-profile, with my paper stackin
Ridin shotgun with the homies gettin blasted
What's crackin? Claimin you's the big OG
Can't come to LBC or on 19th Street
Cold thing about it, I use ta have straight love
I shoulda ran up in your bitch when I knew I could fuck
But the pussy ain't nuttin but a hold in me
and nigga, fuck Snoop Dogg and Master P

[Outro: Tha Realest talking over Chorus]
Hahahahaha
See how we do it on this Death Row shit niggas
Motherfuckers, ain't no shit even goin on and y'all think you some
motherfuckin soldiers
We're the real ridahs, Death Row Westside MOB shit niggas
The real major business in this motherfucker
and get Swoop G and Lil' C-Style in this motherfucker right here

{*sirens*}
Yo emergency
"...emergency"  "...emergency"
"...emergency"  "...emergency"
First up

[Evidence]
Mighty Mi supplied the beat down
These raps are rent paid, four months before I leave town
Cat, we got the hottest shit that ain't been heard yet
To most I'm unknown, but to few; a war vet
I turn checks to cash, but no cash for checks
I never paid for sex, I pay girls to leave after sex
(Get the fuck out..) Play my cassanette then jet
I'm out for blood this year, flows are fangs of death
Specialize in fresh, M.D. veteran vest
There's so much to prove, you lose scoreless
Take Lex, Benz, Beam, convertable 'Vette's
Cribs and credit cards, payment plans in debt (Gimme that)

[Hook]
We present emergency, feel the pressure
No way out, situation gettin closer
Time is tickin, walls are closin
Options narrow now, your the one that's chosen
Yo emergency, emergency, feel the pressure
No way out, situation gettin closer (emergency)
Time is tickin, walls are closin
Options narrow now, your the one that's chosen (emergency)

[Evidence]
Yo dangerous connections, friends are kept seperate
Enemies drive 'em off the road, rev the engine
Levels of suspense, more this year no doubt
The card that you pull, always leave yourself with outs..
Stick to ya guns, stick to ya plans
Stick and hit when ya land, witcha fist and hit a man (boink)
The name of my crew; Dilated Expand
Babu, Iriscience, and myself in Japan
We got international flows
Under the best sign, rockin zodiac clothes
The strong survive in water where sharks are swimmin
Emergency, call the paramedics, lights are dimmin

[Hook]
Yo emergency, emergency, feel the pressure
No way out, situation gettin closer (emergency)
Time is tickin, walls are closin
Options narrow now, your the one that's chosen (emergency)

Emergency, DJ Mighty Mi
Evidence by the mic "emer..emergency"
Watch out! "..mer..mer..emergency..emergency"
   "This is an emergency"

[Evidence]
So check it out
The calm before the storm came
After that, 40 nights and 40 days of rain
Your weakest link, it's your crew, it stink
Numb ya brain, unpredictable patterns, and unpredictable pain
Got attack on hard, raise the game
Right now there's Columbian cats that's raisin 'caine
Los Angeles Lakers dynasty, change the game
Say, Defari and Phil y'all, let's clear the land
That's right, shit's outta control
Do rap music you perform to rock-n-roll
Got lyrics cocked back on trigger ready to pull it
I hitchu like the JFK mystery bullet

[Hook]
Yo emergency, emergency, feel the pressure
No way out, situation gettin closer (emergency)
Time is tickin, walls are closin
Options narrow now, your the one that's chosen (emergency)
Yo emergency, emergency, feel the pressure
No way out, situation gettin closer (emergency)
Time is tickin, walls are closin
Options narrow now, your the one that's chosen (emergency)

Cause later on girl, we gon fuck

Song:   End of the Time
Typed by: nelly@itis.com

Hook:
It all comes down to this, it all comes down (x3)

A lot of match to insense, I'm tense with every sentence
Dence is how my weed is I rock them ill Adidas
Yo my feet is in deep peep my twist lingustics
Loud like Steve Ripkith but most of y'all won't miss it
To some it comes slower others much faster
My rhymes stand out like calliped at the Masters
Ask the question "Yo let me step up"
I say you can't try us cause fools dying 
Before they get the chance like Len Blias
Ride by us they walk well I be hidden in shade 
More content then when rent is paid
And renitent like raider spraid
Oow yo first date is made for those who needed evidence
Becoming ill never defeating the purpose
But I propose my flows goes off the deep end 
Living everyday of the week like a weekend
That's just my lifestyle I'll cut like a knife while
You'll dull like shine never mind it's the end of the time

Hook:
"It's the end of the time" -Group Home

While some crash the backboard I slash the blackboard
With permanet chalf I decode your thought
Thee eraser I will rip apart to make a marker
Flooded with more sheets now lines are darker
But who would of thought when nine years have past
The lines will contain the signs of the pat
And when my day finally comes at last
I resound taking out mad fools in the blast

Evidence will keep it on lyrics hi tech like tron
Visualize pictures drawn in neon
With suttle backdrops blackk for silouetts
Torn up cities that floundered nothing left
No fish in the streams no natural greens
Like a dream or a scene from 2014
But that's the next let my stay on the line
Evidence violated till the end of the time

Hook      (x2)

I pick up vibes like God part of Quarty Hey
Through my brain sends my arms back signals of pain
I take you where I need to go from the scheme to the store
I travel when i flow we can do Mars like Joe
Then stroll back to Earth critique your transmission
You must renovate then innovate in a dimension
Not just of sound and sight but of mind like the twilight
Your rhymes are incomplete like a piece without the highlight
I be that artist painting pictures lyrically
In 3D to make that picture pop out spherically
When I rap I do laps like Tyco race tracks
So I bomb exact I sue my airial map
Poetic contractor design and build
Many intricate messages are messed with skill
Prescriptions are filled by traditional 
Medicinal appressional rhymes
To break down before the end of the time

Hook       (x2)

Outro:
Shit that's how we do it. Dilated Peoples just rule
"It's the end of the time"   (x4)

It's really just elementary ugh!
The turn of the century
Focal point, with forced entry
Force not to be reckoned with
Second wind sets in
Jolt of electricity
Sting with synchronicity
Scorpions' tail snaps
Crippling simplicity
Walk through the desert
Warm breath
Creates a sandstorm
Transform
Rattle Snake Strike
Smell your hands warm
Fangs puncture palms, venom
Seeps through your veins
Pain you shouldn't intervene
See me on the center screen
Kaleidoscope
Aqua blue, turquoise
And winter green
Sunshine blasting
Bright beams of ultraviolet, ugh!
Violence sentenced, stylist
Causes silence

Temperature very low
Icicle hell storm
Bellows a row
Between the channel of the cable
And the cross bow
Comes an elevation
Of pressure
In regards
Compel a high water
When all hell freezes over
And breaks loose in a hand basket
Idle hands
Mastered my mix down
Instead of slinging tools in
Fallen Angel's workshop
Burning the once lifted
Whip in the place of galley
A quick trip through the gallery
And I'll see all that I need
Death on a pale steed
Heads on a steel blade
Treads on a shallow grave
Ball on a hollow acrylic frame
The future flashes redundancy
Do what you can to fuck the industry

A captain can't abandon his ship
Stranded I randomly rip
Rap with a strangling grip
I'm mangling quick
Prevails a hard rocker
You're just a dangling dick
That's about 3 inches
At first it kind pinches
Then it burns like
You wouldn't believe
When I get in you
Any venue
Mad Childs flaming
You're on the menu
Let's Continue
First I'll send you to
The fiery depths
With molten core
Is molding
Hey, don't suck my dick just hold it
I took and shook the house first
We rocked it
Then we rolled it
I told you I was holding
Four aces
You shoulda folded

I dig what I rip
With greater expectations
And heavy way
Loaded to the teeth
The dull steel hull of
My fully war equipped skull
Shoots down the sand bags
Cancel the streak able
Award winning costumes and makeup
Big tops and wild villains
Break up the chameleon
It's to blend and devise the fabric
Hybrids of natural schematics
Plastic coated human
Form makes them easy targets
For rifle practice

E'rything you see is not, a 7-4 king
The son of cocaine, new form of dope man
Plus I'm holdin weight, cause I'm the dope man

Interstate runner, watch me drive a brick through
And we ain't backin down, way past rappin now
Right before my album drop my homeboys'll clap you down

Bein a celebrity bringin me mo' bitches
In a position I'm watched by mo' snitches

Artist: Silkk the Shocker f/ Fiend
Album:  N.W.A. 10th Anniversary Tribute (Straight Outta Compton)
Song:   Express Yourself
Typed by: dy_face@hotmail.com

[Intro: Silkk the Shocker]
There's a lot of brothers out there claimin' to 'Bout it 
And Soldiers, but they scared to kick reality

[Fiend]
Man, you been doin' all these movies and videos
You're really had a chance to show the world what's really happenin'

[Silkk the Shocker]
So what you want me to do?

Express yourself! ------> DJ Yella

[Verse 1: Silkk the Shocker]
I'm expressin' with my full capabilities
And now I'm livin' in correctional facilities
Cause some don't agree with how I do this
I get straight and meditate like a Buddhist
I'm a soldier my behaviour is hereditary
And my technique is very necessary
Blame it on Master P, because he said we get bout it
And drop lyrics, to get them rowdy
Add it on a dope beat; and here it'll make you think
Some suckers just tickle me pink to my stomach
Cause they don't flow like this one
You know what? - I won't hesitate to diss one or two before I'm through
so don't try to sing this
Some drop science; while I'm droppin' english
Even if Tha Pound, makes the a-capella
I still express, yo, I don't gangbang or claim sess
But it divides the world apart
It's hard in the wealth, like Dr. Gales in New York
So stop trippin, cause you know we are equal "check your wealth"
And this is for my people
And uhh..

[Chorus: Silkk the Shocker X2]
Express yourself!
Say what you wanna say, do what you feel
Go on and do it..
Be what you wanna be, get it how you will
Express yourself!

[Verse 2: Silkk the Shocker]
Now I'm back.. back to the streets 
That's where I'm from, so that's where I be
Now, it's fact, to drop rap that's hard to swallow 
Worth millions of dollars while real G's got to follow
Me, I throw the bands, twenties by the spin
Again and again and again, tryin' to avoid the pen
Just because I said some things people scared to say
And uhh.. a lot of DJs might just be scared to play
Now, I can be the coldest Emcee, but I can't win that Bout
Why? - cause I curse too much and uhh.. I came to from the south
But it's crazy, to see what people be
What society wants them to be
But not me, Rowdy, is the way to go, they know
Others say rhymes which fail to be original
Or they kill for the Hip-Hop starts
Forget about the ghetto and just start raps for the pop charts
Some musicians, they cuss at home
But scared to use profanity when upon the microphone
Yeah, they want reality, but you will hear none
They'd rather exaggerate a little fiction
Hypocrites say no to drugs, and take a stand
But after the show, they go lookin' for the "Dopeman" ---> Eazy-E
Or they ban my group from the Radio
Hear some for NO Limit and they be like.. "Hell no!"
But what elses, you know, they all about law
As long as you keep it real and ..

[Chorus: Silkk the Shocker X2]
Express yourself!
Say what you wanna say, do what you feel
Go on and do it..
Be what you wanna be, get it how you will
Express yourself!

[Silkk the Shocker]
That from the heart
Cause if you wanna start, to move up the chart
Expression is a big part of it
You ain't efficient when you flow, you ain't swift
Movin' like a tortoise, that full of Rigor Mortis
I got a little bit more to show
I got rhymes in my mind, that shoot like a .44
or a lesson - all of them expression
And if you start flexin, I got a Smith and Wessun for you

[Break: Silkk the Shocker]
You this is dedicated to the realist group I know N.W.A.
Fiend drop that

[Fiend]
Now, look I express myself, the best I know how  
Like runnin' with the poor niggaz towards to move the crowd "Soldiers" ---> Master P
You gotta clear my show?
I'm from the project to house on the hill
Stay real cause the game starts changin' cause I made meals
My Company, it means sky is the limit
My parnter say one day, I'ma buy the building
How could you imagine the rhythem, now picture me rollin'
Have all these rappin' and Donuts move this acrobat to sellin'
Sure, the world is yours, anything you want you can get it
Just put your mind into, and be about your business
But you don't know, what the purpose I have
This ideas is kept unto yourself
Man, follow your dreams, could you express yourself?

[Chorus: X2]
Express yourself!, go on and do it..
Express yourself!, awww do it..

[Outro: Silkk the Shocker]
Yeah, this goes out to N.W.A. - y'all just expressed yourselves
And We expressed our selves
To all tuners that makin' wild, y'all keep your head up, sky is the limit
I want say what's up, Andi Shack, (*Names*) No Limit
Ant Banks, Craig D, all the homies locked down, express yourself
East to West
Now, I don't hear no Rapper talkin' about, he did it for love
So while you're doin' it for love, we're gettin' it for money y'all
Silkk the Shocker, I'm out

Typed by: Cno Evil

[Streetlife]
Sniff on this good shit, that got your eyes swollen
Your nose strippin', what's that shit you sippin'
My mind's trippin', sometimes I feel I'm slippin'
I feel like slippin' a clip in and start flippin'
I figured you out (yeah) I got reasonable doubt
You'se a loud mouth, that's not what a thug is about
You'se a homo nigga, that just caught a deal
Just because you got money, don't make you real
I tell it like it is, because, this is how I feel
Just because you got guns, don't mean you kill
Just because your top drop, don't make you hot
Braggin' about what got, might get you shot

[Chorus: Killa Sin]
Yo-yo-yo-yo, yo, fuck 'em! Leave 'em face down
Yeah! Side up, from the waist down
Yup! He's sized up for the grave now
Lay down, nigga, just stay down

[Killa Sin]
We like four steps ahead of you, dick
You small claims court, we federal
Style's want investibles, quit actin' like you never knew
Bitch nigga vegetable stew, no beef
All this procedes, for the gold teeth and more grief
Man I told you they was gonna sleep, Street
Never mind heat for these freaks
Catch Cooley on High like Cochise
Make 'em scream, going from yelling O.G. to Oh Jesus
Can't believe this muthafucka knocked out my gold teeth
Just pardon me, god, for using your name in vein
But it's like these salt watered card niggaz spoiled the game
Your money and fame, won't bury all the worry and pain
When I hot rock pop and rock the side of your brain

[Chorus]

[Streetlife]
Microphone check, I got dough to get
I never sweat, I approach the mic like a seasoned vet
Auto death, threat you send, I haven't seen 'em yet
When we step on the set, y'all be quiet as kept
When we come through, y'all just move through the left
All that 'rah-rah' talk, you keep it under your breath
I suggest y'all show the Street nigga respect
I'm not a rap cat, I just rap for the check
And I will tap that chin, if you get out of text
If you feel that, you can disrespect what I rep
I'm from Shaolin (what) you better watch your step
Remember what the Wu told you, Protect Ya Neck
This the Jump Off, I'mma show you how they really get wreck
You get knocked off, when I black eye, to smash the specs
Your best bet is just to cop out, put down the tech
That's not gangsta, I don't care how much you slept

[Killa Sin]
Yo, I got a head full of time and nigga
Fuck around, you be heading for the trauma center, messin' with mine
Keep a closet full of hammers, I ain't stressin' your nine
So keep them pea shooters to yourself, study your wealth
You gonna need some of that money, to fuck with your health
I'm trynna front for me, dummy, you'd rather front for yourself
(Have you leakin', runnin' from the scenes screamin' for help)
Knowing your shit trash, last to sell, the worst on the shelf

Song:   Fanatic
Typed by: Byg_Balla

[Chorus]
I'm a F-A-N-A-T-I-C, Fanatic
I rep Christ till I D-I-E, Fanatic
I'm not extreme, I'm redeemed with faith
To serve a God whose extremely great
I'm a Fanatic

[Verse One]
The world's trying to tidy up, exfoliate they skin
but only Christ can come and exfoliate they sin
And they fate look grim, If they don't take him
As the high priest he is to mediate they sin
The world's got to many Gods, man we choose the one
From hebrews, he rules, he bruised his son
He moves the sun
So if we prayin and our schools call us fools
Cuz our God's too true to shun
Channels two in one
Man it looks insane
TV make a lot Christians seem dramatically strange
Though we may be looked upon as one and same
We will not turn in shame, we proclaim the name
Christ Jesus, believe us, you ain't gotta recieve us
but we gon' follow our God wherever the bible lead us
And you can call us dramatic, fanatic, emphatic
But hate while you at it, take a look at our mathematics

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
What can I do to make it simple, make it plain
Christ came, emptied himself and let out sin hang him
You couldn't blame him for any sin
While they singing many men
The crucifixion was pretty grim
But when we state the fact that God resurrects
We get funny looks from a world that doesn't get
We are not David Koresh or Krishna
Or the people on TV who glorifying their bishop
From Edwards to Piper, MacAurther to Spurgeon
From Dallas to France, From Cali to Berlin
As Christians all over who getting the word in
We ain't crazy we just understand the truth and we burdened
The world sees us as evangelical Christians
As narrow-minded fanatics with a mythical mission
Labeled extremists for sharing out faith
But thats cool, we can carry the weight of persecution
Cuz earth is losing
And if we yelling the truth
We honored to be the people that our God is using
So keep it moving
Cuz if we yelling the truth
We honored to be the people that our God is using

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
They thought Jesus was out of his mind
they laughed and mocked him
Called him a cult leader and they tried to stop him
Pharisees said Christ got his power from Satan
Hatin', on the very one that came to save 'em
Even after he rose, man the world ain't changed
They still rejecting the name, still look at us strange
Still tell us without shame that our faith's insane
and, "it don't take all that to be a Christian man"
And its hard when you tryin to reach your family and stuff
They say man, "you too spiritual, you doing to much"
So we show them the love of Christ and live in the light
So they can glorify our God when they look at our life
And we win for sharing the truth and hearts get changed
We win if we're rejected because of his name
We win if seeds get planted and watered and grow
But even if we lost, we still be Fanatical though

Yo... yo...

Verse One: Ghostface

Wally champ so amazin, the suede shoelacin
up in the Sheraton, just got hit for five years probation
I got a dental appointment at two o'clock there go my gold ring
Much later catch a flick or go hoeing
Yo there's somethin heavy on my mind from last night's crime
Spoonface shot Gel in the back with Kiv's nine
It was two men, tighter than a hiker with Tims
Like blood brothers, problem was they lust each other woman
For instance, Gel seen Spoon in DeMoore
He wet his whiz(tle), got his seed an headin towards the door
They came out of eye, face to face, they embraced
Gel blew a kiss and looked Spoon girl in the face
Her face lit up, and grinned with a smile like what?
That sneaky f--k, same bitch that got my man hit up
Out in Brownsville, where the thug life live to kill
Where bodies is worth two for five cause it's real
Fast life...

        Fast life, cause there's nowhere I can go
        Fast life, that's the only thing I know
        Fast life, cause there's nowhere I can go
        Fast Life, that's the only life I know

Verse Two: Andre Rison

Yo my man got more power than gunpowder with ammunition
Blowin up the fireworks and the n----z ambitions
On the come up, she gettin done up, behind closed doors
Doin freaky s--t, on elevator floors
I want her, like Sonny wanted Cher
She was his diamond piece, sex wasn't for lease
Rest in peace, somebody came up deceased
R.I.P. on that grave of the slave of infatuated ways
God couldn't save
F-A-K-E, L-O-V-E
Fake love you see
Never lasting through eternity
Living life in the fast lane
The fast life... it's the fast life
Fast life

        Fast life, cause there's nowhere I can go
        Fast life, that's the only thing I know
        Fast life, cause there's nowhere I can go
        Fast Life, that's the only life I know 
        Fast life, cause there's nowhere I can go
        Fast life, that's the only thing I know
        Fast life, cause there's nowhere I can go
        Fast Life, that's the only life I know

So it's on again
Tell me, do you hear what I hear?
"Louder, louder, louder"

[Verse One] [Finsta]
Now who want what we got?
We rock from dungeons to rooftops
We chart while crews pop
Fuck your case history and keep your stay short
This our way of life, see we nicer than you thought
Perhaps if we had picture cards
To help you figure
You wouldn't discard mad shit that we deliver
My mind travel, like platinum artists thirsty for the cheddar
They don't know, see we came to train them better
Then those who oppose this righteous mad militia
Keep foes on their toes, assemble like artisti-

I hope to blow like a bitch
Can't take the stress, too many fraud niggas rich
Not only that
You see, they fuckin' with my music
And I'm not included while they fuckin' up my music

[Chorus] [x2]
As the room spins the boom within
Triggers to lungs to begin
So it's on again
Tell me, do you hear what I hear?
"Louder, louder, louder"

[Verse Two] [Bundy]
Lyrics ferocious so check for dosage
Can't have overdosin' on views we composin'
Too many heads don't be knowin'
So every word's chosen
To melt the frozen that be dosin' off while they posin'
If you feel it then you're ready for the motion
This ain't for play
Fruits of life we bestoyin'
While others chase the glow in that drink 
Until they droven by material that's woven by humans
Yo man, who you jokin'?
See we transmit to the masses
Surpassin' the asses that are fiends for the cash
You know that don't last
But Finsta Bundy paragraphs 
Breaks niggas ass from the Bush to Bangladash

[Chorus] [x2]
As the room spins the boom within
Triggers to lungs to begin
So it's on again
Tell me, do you hear what I hear?
"Louder, louder, louder"

[Verse Three] [Bundy]
Some ask, "Who this?"
Wait a minute we been through this
So why must I come down like a Brutus

[Finsta]
Now when we bless this
Piece of papyrus
Niggas won't laugh at this
We some of the nicest
Kids with precise shit
That we suffice with
We keep your mental lit
Like that boom shit
So when we comin' down
Best to know the odds fuckin' with this odd couple
Right this way is far from subtle
Quick to take the head of a violator of the tribe
It's nothing personal, I just can't take the lies
Trickery
And mystery we deal with facts
Bitches tryin' to make they way, layin' on they backs
Fuck that and anything similar
The shit we bringin' to
The table
Will enable my children to buy land and stables
We capable of uprootin'
Bad seeds whose recruitin'
The blinds to the ways of the wicked
They dyin' so we rip shit
Sometimes explicit

[Chorus] [x2]
As the room spins the boom within
Triggers to lungs to begin
So it's on again
Tell me, do you hear what I hear?
"Louder, louder, louder"

[Outro]
Finsta Bundy comin', niggas livin' in fear
Just hide your bitches, keep the tops on your beers
Keep it to yourself as I'm movin' this here

Finsta Bundy forever [x4]
Feel it [x4]

Album:  Da Ambush - Da (Pure) Hip-Hop Compilation
Song:   Final Exit
Typed by: jostmatt@bluewin.ch

Weighin' the options of life and death
Fantasizin', goddamn it'd be nice to rest
A .38 Smith & Wess' up against my flesh
A nigga finally feelin' blessed once the trigger's pressed
Deep thoughts about my family, how would they react?
Insomniac, left his world like a maniac
A self-inflicted gunshot left me stretched out
Stressed out, so depressed I chose the best route
My family probably havin' fits cause I called it quits
My niggas mad cause they probably think it was a bitch
That shoe fits but it's small like a combination
No bitch alone can send me to eternal condemnation
Shit I'm facin's got me sittin' at the edge of my bed
Head achin' cause I'm cryin' as I beg to be dead
I can't wait until this hot slug enters my head
Finally for Mark tears are eventually shed
Dear God, I can't believe my life has come to this
I soak my arms up in ice tryin' to numb my wrist
I think about the opportunities I've had and blown
Got nothin' else to do but think cause I'm that alone
My hope is gone, went to college but I fucked it up
Got kicked out, but my heart told me: suck it up!
So I did, spent the next few years in hell
I'm losing job after job seein' dreams fail
Seein' niggas who ain't shit get the luxuries
Nice guys finish last, who gives a fuck for me?
Reluctantly put the barrel underneath my chin
My only witness is my best friends, weed and gin
They know my sin cause I talk to 'em every night
My forty ounce is always there when me and God fight
I close my eyes tight, ready for the twilight
My life and death is just another ghetto highlight
Goodbye life

[ CHORUS 2X ]
Dear God, do you listen when I cuss you out?
Don't it provoke you to respond to what I'm fussin 'bout?
Don't it concern you that I'm losin' my belief
Confusion from massive grief got me on my knees
Why you refusin' to send relief?

I spend most of my lonely existence thinkin', conversatin'
Tellin' the master of creation what I'm contemplatin'
Arguin', sometimes yellin', tears swellin'
Threatenin' to put one in my melon, finally expellin'
My tormented soul from this unbearable hell I dwell in
Searchin' like Magellan to exit this hole I fell in
This hole I live in, askin' God am I not forgiven
For my crimes in a previous life
Was I a sinner cursin God in a devious life?
Does Jesus Christ hold a grudge against me while others live the easiest life?
With no struggles, no stress, no test
Never knowin' demons like loneliness, never depressed
Never jobless, never on they hands and knees
Beggin' God please cure this poor man's disease
Was everything in church just religious fantasies
Destroyed by science findin' ancient man's debris?
If you listenin' God speak to me and answer these
Questions we been askin' since we covered plants with leaves
Why do good people feel Satan's wicked embrace?
Why are good people sick and displaced?
Why are good people forced to live a life that is empty and stressed?
While the wicked seem happy and blessed
Talk to me, the devil's tryin' to walk through me
Will you respond or will the coroner be forced to put the chalk to me?

Typed by: jostmatt@bluewin.ch

Yo
Everybody in the Flavor Unit is real def
But we're gonna make one record altogether
Who's gonna go first?

[ VERSE 1: Apache ]
Here's another rapper that thought he caught me 'sleep
MC's, you feel frogous - leap
Rhymin dictionaries - on the contrary
Your style's plain, it stays the same, mines vary
>From a to z, just like the alphabet
Find another brother to [fuck] with, cause I'ma get
Angry, then run through the chain of command 
The last to stand fled, cause he's a dead man
Egos are bruised, MC's get confused
I filter out the wack, then cruise
Past at a swift pace, let's lace 
The rhyme with dope - take a toke, just in case
The song's too strong, take two pulls and pass
Smoke fumes from the mic might make you gasp
For another breath, it's a slow death
Fight, you tried, but you died, now who's left?
Dead on arrival, if you survive you'll
Remember the name, Flavor Unit'll guide you
Apache, that's me, so flee
Stop talkin, I'm a walkin one-man posse
You're steppin on thin ice, flexin smooth and nice
Each cut's precise, here's some advice
A lotta power, it's time to peep the God
Of the Flavor Unit Assassination Squad

[ VERSE 2: Lakim Shabazz ]
There's no need to wonder why you was kept in the dark
Your rhymes are not flowin, they're showin stretchmarks
Who told you we were dead broke?
Thinkin you're choice and your voice sound like you got a stretched throat
You're just another duck, a certified buttercup
You better duck, I'm throwin lyrical uppercuts
Verses are versatile, I'm worth your while
Put a punk against me, I murder the child
Thinkin of a mystery that gets to me
Playin around sayin you're gonna dis the G
You wish to be, just like me
You wanna battle me? I insist that we
Toss up a coin - head's up, now let's kick off 
The Hip-Hop Superbowl, see who'll get picked off
Not me, I'ma win by a mile or two
And make you feel like a molecule
I stand in the square of pure righteousness
Your song was dope, but yo, it's not hype as this
They say you live a life of the rich and famous
To me it's the life of the weak and nameless
Rappers get roasted, toasted, barbecued
Lyrics explode and blown into particles
Thought you were sly and slick, a clever cat
You take me out? Yo - never that
I'm God a, descendant of Master Farrahd
The Flavor Unit Assassination Squad

[ VERSE 3: Queen Latifah ]
Make a wish like Aladdin 
I'ma step to the mic, you wish you hadn't
Cause I get mad when 
You attempt to invade my queendom
Stop dreamin, don't hand me that
I murder main men handicapped
A female prevails, start bitin your nails
You're nervous, join the service, I'm hyped as hell
The feminine teacher in the form of Queen Latifah
I hype the mic and pump the speakers
I don't wanna dig too deep, who are you to sleep?
On me, the Queen of the Flavor Unit posse
You wanna step? Then step hard
This is the Flavor Unit Assassination Squad

[ VERSE 4: Double J ]
I listen to some riff while the others stand stiff
I'll uplift the gift and have nothin to deal with
You're bull, some get pull from, it hurts my nerve
But I'ma serve, give em what they deserve
They wanna try to act hot like they just won a jackpot
Think they can flow (but no, not by a long shot)
The J without delay here to display
While other rappers decay the Flavor Unit will stay
On the top of the situation 
Untouchable concentration leads to elevation
We'll stay untouched with the style that's too much
As the mic gets clutched, such
A dope voice puts fear in your heart through your ear
Listen close, and you'll hear
The Unit coincide as one, outsiders run
You want respect? Forget it, you're gettin none
I'll advise, improvise, teach you learnin
Get respect the old fashion way - we'll earn it
But you execute before I'm through, yo
This is what I'm prepared to do 
Rock that ass real fast, the nation's hard
The Flavor Unit Assassination Squad

[ VERSE 5: Lord Alibaski ]
Get swift possession, a lyrical session 
A family affair, Alibaski's lettin 
Off another dose of words to shank a man
Tenacious, the hip-hop anchorman
Little bit of rep growin and it's dominant
Roll MC's over on my own ???
Since the beat 68 causes a swirl
Creating the 8th wonder of the world
It's my turn, so I think I'll flow till
I can make a mountain out of a molehill
The King will let off his beat that's so chill
Release me, so I can go kill
Competators who work through hours of rain
I'm a notorious lenchman, I got powers of pain
Pure punishment, so run and get
Reserves, so I can serve abundant with
Ship em out to me, cause the dollars are greener
The verse quenched your thirst with dope misdemeanor
Are you capable? Spit it out, tell me are you able
Or would you prefer the view from the ??? table
Razorsharp, hits are bein landed
Played my part, diss, I'm countin heads, and
The dynamic duo of the Flavor, you know
Ready for any- and everybody or who, so
Be it, when my lyrics fill the air
I get hungry, and the mic's my silverware
I played it cool, you face your doom, I'm large

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
That's right, yo, listen

[Prodigal Sunn]
It goes, one for the family, birth from pure sanity
Two for humanity, wrapped up in vanity
Three for reality, escape from the cavity
Make room for clarity, practice solidarity
Do it for the charities, less fortune then tragedies
Hold it down like gravity, don't run with batteries
Toast grapes, smoke weight, I twist a whole eighth
Host my own mixtape, Sunny came to get it straight
Attitude feeling great, your food on the plate
Cash at a fast rate, through every city, country, state
Home to cop real estate, 'menace' like Larenz Tate
Diamond in the glass case, mask with the black face
Hash with that purple eight, yo from that Myrtle gate
Enough to help me meditate, find a team, legislate
Stay moving with planner, you moving out of manners
Slugs peal like bananas through your cameras
Yeah...

[The Reverend William Burk]
Yo, we don't tie while we laced, and sharp with money traces
Short phone conversations, long with meditations
Good sex, perspirations, musical inspiration
Quiet storm dawn, love song dedications
It's the Chi-Town sorcerer, wizard from course of co-dodging
The coroner peep the formula, money moving from Florida
Been observing the game, like a foreigners brain
Cuz I'm at war with my oppressors, and this poverty thing
I'm from the C He Islam, C Allah God Cypher
Where pigs assasinate brothers like snipers
Watch for vapors and the vipers, peace to righteous and the lifers

We got purple drank, and stick dank
Living life, like you know we should, ha

[D-Reck]
I was feeling pimp-a-licious hustla-ticious, playa-dochas so I wrote this
You can quote this from the locest, in the lab with nocus pocus
Staying focused on the mash, get on feet getting your cash
Tummy growling touch my back, palms itching like a rash
I do the thang how I want, spit the game make my point
Sprinkle her brain now it's on, we gon roll from dusk till dawn
I'm teaching her she teaching me, I'm touching her she touching me
She hugging me she rubbing me, she struggle with me she loving me
She hustle with me tussle with me, on me partna thugging with me
Down ass dame with similar brain, boys get to the game
I pimp it like I eat it, I touched it and delete it
Complete it and repeat it, if I don't need it then I leave it
If you down or you ain't, if you not then you can't
Get no bank no dank, no X or no drank
Get inside if you gon ride, pay attention eyes wide
You gotta be up on it if you wanna, rest that ass on buck hide

[Hook - 2x]

[Tyte Eyez]
Sipping drank, with that sticky dank
Sitting low to the road, in a candy red tank
Chilling with a hundred thee, in the bank
We steal the flo', my team won't sink
Please don't blink, cause you might miss me
Cause I'm moving through the hood, quite quickly
In a big drop top, white V
Sitting low to the street, on 23's
It's Tyte Eezie please believe me, I'ma have a dime piece breezy
On her kneezies on that easy, and that coochie gon be greasy
If she sleazy, I'ma pass that
I'm from the hood, I don't love no rats
Use to packing, them slugs and gats
But now I switched the game, now I'm busting raps
But don't get it twisted, I'll bust a cap
Hush lil' nigga, gon take you a nap
Rush you in the night, and you might just crap
Crush right bone, and your neck might snap
On the map, that Dirty 3
Way down South, you best believe
We gon have a lot of drank, by the bank
And a lot of candy paint, and the best of weed

[Hook - 2x]

[Kiotti]
Maybe in a Corolla Coupe, Houpe with a solo roof
Or a 0-3, Beeeenz
It's 3's 84's, Spre's low's mo-mo's
Or some twinkie, two Lorenz
As long as it got candy paint, we ain't picky
As long as it got candy paint, it be sticky
As long as the paint wet, drippy-drippy
My pinky make the atmosphere, nippy-nippy
I may floss, like a dental procedure
My trunk make the midnight be bright, street light we don't need ya
I hate that, bad have to leave her
But now it's top drop on a gold road, next to Jesus
We make, atheists believe us
And do the team song, three in action in chrome on low feeters
Music sound clear, in low speakers
My world is a block, I wanna teach you like a preacher
Why you peeing me, R.I.P. F-A-T P-A-T baby

Real shit

[Wale]
I just want my mind to be free
Never mind if they fond of me, I've been a beast
I recline in my seat, #9's on my feet
Womanizer admittingly, but mind you I'm deep
Although they inclined to critique
Motherfuck 'em they couldn't lace up a nigga Chukckers
Cause money talk and I make them busters pay for discussin
Chasin duckets, chasin dreams got me prayin for foes
Chasin hoes, dick 'em good enough to make 'em propose
Winnin the feelin is so incredible
Somethin that's forever true, my niggaz over revenue
Little bit of Chanel, decorate your appearance
Double C's on your purses, perfect I get the message
Isabel Marant I get you some, you give me that
All of my thoughts fluorescent ink though I'm always thinkin black
Sittin back, cognac, 62 behind the pack
I ain't thug, but I ain't stupid four niggaz, five straps
Hold up~! Fire shots for the winner
And as long as I'm deliverin, this genre's gon' be winnin
Double M-G pimpin, my relevance never endin
My penmanship ain't too pretty, my ink is why they gon' feel me

[Chorus: Wale]
This ink is why they feel me, this ink is why they feel me
This ink is why they feel me, Lord, this ink is why they feel me
This ink is why they feel me, this ink is why they feel me
This ink is why they feel me, Lord, this ink is why they feel me
Double M-G, thank you this the real me

[Stalley]
I got a couple old schools and some new girls
They like old jewels, and new pearls
They obey no rules, they some rude girls
You know the bad ones, that rule the world
They just wanna have fun, and crash parties
But when them games is over, they down to ride for me
Bonnie & Clyde story, Mick & Mallory
A killer in them sheets, they bring that ish up out of me
After that I sit and count a G after G
Cause it's right back to these ends
Send her on her way, tell her come back with some friends
We can do it all again
The repetition that I like, the reputation of a pimp
And I do it all on him, peep the way I limp
Pimp walk I been brought my chick, it was money well spent
They say it's cold blooded how I talk
I been winnin this way for years, so what if I ain't lost?

[Chorus]

Sometimes it's like

Fly guy

Now wait just a minute, could this be true?
Boogie Boys got a rumor on the avenue
Tryina diss females on their finesse
Ain't got a dime in your pocket, no type of interest
Could it be, baby doll, that you're diggin for gold?
You got to dig a little deeper cause we're just that cold
Fly guys got plenty women, yes they're playin the role
But I'm a too hot to hold and you must be told
It's true I love a man who is aimin to please
When it's time to get sweet there's somethin up your sleeve
No you don't quite have it, no you're not the man
This ain't slam-bam, thank you m'am, understand?
Huh, you're wastin time, yes I do believe
Cause the life that I lead, it takes a pro to read
I told you once, I told you twice and I'll tell you again
You won't get the seven digits, so get rid of the pen
My mother is a lawyer, yes this is true
And my father is a doctor, what it means to you?
Yes the family tree is what you want to join
From this bank account you won't get a coin
Like ( ? ) nine to five
( ? ) very independent, yes kickin it live
I like a real fly cutie, like a GQ style
He just dress to impress, he's on the top of the pile
The brown-skinned fellas are the ones ( ? )
( ? ) their love is everlastin that this girl needs

A fly guy

(Fly guy)

You know I'm bubblin brown, known all over the town
My name is Pebblee Poo and I love to get down
5 foot 2, always cuttin a smile
You can never ever say that I'm not the right gal
My sign is Gemini for those who don't know
I'm about much gold and all the gusto
Wear a gold name chain and the name earrings
( ? ) is the real sure thing
When I drive up in a ride you may call it a swing
But when I glance at yours I say, "That old thing?"
Your car have three wheels, no type of shocks
And seem to cut off every three to four blocks
You said to get comfortable, you said to rest my tush
But your car is a sissy, now get out and push
You don't have to drive a car to impress the Poo
Cause if your pockets ain't workin, then your rap is through
I don't sport a ( ? ) bag but I like to style
I also like to be different, somethin worth your while
I could never wear Cazel's, now be for real
I might as well got a spot on the football field
The Poo wear a Kangol, have you gone mad?
I'm a fly girl, baby, not the man from ( ? )
Yes I am a fly girl speakin my mind
And I speak up for the ladies cause we one of a kind
Fly girls all around, don't eat the puppy chow
Or deal with the who, what, why or how
I could really get nasty, so to speak
Let me ask you a question, what do y'all eat?
No fluorescent sauces, not a type of taste
Ha, know your funky sneakers when they're screamin the bass
You know your socks are chokin if they're pleadin for help
When it's time to do the laundry, yes you do it yourself
We know you like to wear sneakers every now and then
Stop tryina fit a size 12 into a 10
You know the mud in your toes is suffocatin your nose
So put a seed in between it and watch how it grows

How can you call yourself fly, think it's all about you
When your arms can't keep a secret, smellin up the crew
Fly guys always talkin 'bout what they did
Got 22 ladies and 15 kids
To top it all off, they're not worth the fight
Lookin like ( ? )
They just wanna be on, yes the talk of the town
But on they feet they got the ( ? ) from Buster Brown
Got a head full of curls that refuse to blow
Hair done at a bakery, poppin fresh 'fro
And let's not forget about the styles, you see
I think it's called 'Buy a razor, get a jersey free'

Don't mean to be rude but what have they been lickin?
Throw on the bass and you know the breath is kickin
Cologne's not workin, muscles all out of place
And you can play tic or tac or toe on their face
You could never be on top with any acne spots
Love the life you live with connectin your dots
Clearasil will make your face much clearer
Fly guys know what? Take a look in the mirror
Can't stand a fly guy with his nose in the air
Actin like he has dollars but he's on welfare
Got butter on his teeth, now that's a fact
The fact most of their clothes were homemade from scratch
You just wanna be seen with a fly female
With the manicured hairs and the gold finger nails
Well I hate to bust your bubble but you have failed
Because most of those ladies purchase them on sale
Fellas at times will be doin you wrong
Yo when the girls get hip they start swingin their charm
Baby doll it won't work, go where ya belong
Ya go on-cha-cha-on-cha-on-cha-on-on
You were very out of place about the painted on jeans
When your no-name brand should never be seen
Need to go upstairs, read a couple of books
And don't come down till you improve your looks
You could never be so fly to talk to Pebblee
With your boulevard shoes singin "Lean on me"
Don't have to earn a talent, fly girl herself
My name is Pebblee Poo and I'm on the top shelf

A fly guy

(A fly guy)

( ? ) smells like anything goes
When all that you wear are 'summer' clothes
Some of his clothes, some of his clothes
Some of his clothes, and some of his clothes
I'm the Pebblee Poo with the Poo y'all
Y'all, the Pebblee Poo with the Poo y'all

Song:   Funny Style - Part One
Typed by :Nelson2014@aol.com

Hook:
Funny people funny style 
Let me go and make this money while
You talk about
Can't walk around without it like American Express
There jealous ass fellas got me thinkin' about a vest

Imani:
I'm avoiding you and you crew for the obvious reasons
Because you and your man always be schemin'
Straight hatin' mine
You ain't relatin' to mine
I'm tryin' to do mine
And you tryin' to intervene on mine
Go in-between the guidelines
Yo ass is now straight hatin' from the sidelines
Cause you flyin' sidewind

Bootie Brown:
Every funny style 
You know there's many people out there livin' in denial
Have a smile like it's AD but shit be like a rain cloud
No use for being loud
Talking bout your skrilla 
But you askin' me for a dub to buy some killer chronic 
So I find it behind at this rap shit but it's got you excited
I can't fight it
It's got me too 
But misjudgment can lead you down the wrong path
And all I get is a cold hearted laugh
For the funny people, funny style
And I'm gonna make this pile (what?)

Hook

Bootie Brown:
And fatigues
Fools are outta there leagues
Stuck in minor, I'm moving to major
Fuck a phone and a pager
Lab top 
Forty acres with my cash crop
To keep the ski steady flowin'

"ho ho ho" - scratching
money money money (x4)

Hook

Bootie Brown:
Aye you keep me laughing like Rich in Jo Jo Dancer (ha ha ha)
Thinkin' that they know the answer 
Like machines that record incoming calls
Screening like Siskel critiquing all of y'all
Thumb up or thumb down
Those are Shaky like Pizza 
I'm always outta town for two weeks
Funny style are the true geeks
Yo Imani please use feet

Imani:
Reminition is to make the ends blend and meet 
But sometimes to incline can be too steep for the feet 
And sometimes we might even find it feek (keep it movin')
But the main function is to... (keep it movin')
The currency in every week (keep it movin')
Listen to the words I speak (keep it movin')
You only fall in deep cause you sleep

Hook (x2)

Outro:
Gotta vest man. Gotta vest man. Gotta make that skrilla man. 
DJ EQ. And ya don't stop and ya don't quit. 
Pharcyde in the house with the ultimate shit. 
Gotta get the cash gotta get the doe. 
Gotta get the cash gotta let you know. 
Gotta get the cash gotta get the doe.

To all you MC's, who don't already know this
Here's my word of advice, so take it as no diss
For your information, until it's further notice
I hope somebody quote this, too many brothers lose..

Now what's the use of rhymin when you can't, do what you feel
You ready to sacrifice and sign your life just to get a deal
They got you by the strings, when there's no creative control
Dollars amount to nuttin when your body don't have a soul
It's like, livin with no skeletal frame, you'd rather
settle for fame, and play the game instead of critical acclaim
To floss, gettin this cheese it's understandble, to live, suitable
But y'all forget that these monies is still recoupable
I know you got enough sense, to pay attention
No need to be a scholar to comprehend the facts about the dollar
You follow trends, you drive a Benz and don't know how to make ends
merge, and power surges knockin off your icebergs
Submerge into a slow death, the realm where you have no breath
You find yourself, by yourself, with nothin left
Holdin a bad hand, and swimmin in a pool of card sharks
Losin your record deal in all your reels you didn't top charts

To all you MC's, who don't already know this (FOCUS)
Here's my word of advice, so take it as no diss (FOCUS)

Here's my word of advice, so take it as no diss (FOCUS)
For your information, until it's further notice
I hope somebody quote this, too many brothers lose..

So catch my shutter speed, quick snapshot, my steadycam
get cheddar to make it better try to be a family man and
hold down the fort because they extort, before you know it
you in court, for takin this rap game as a sport (then play on)
So grab the joystick, and make sure that your voice thick
Be on point, it's not always the joint your boys pick so
later for the yes men, cause you the best man
Forget the world cause it be stressin, settle for nothin less than
Make sure you skills ain't nuttin to be tested in the pocket
Deep like Steve Young, don't let nobody intercept
or cockblock like contraceptives, industry STAY deceptive
Executive, decidin who they let live (so what gives?)
It's on you, the choice of who survivin
Cause once you sign, ain't no turnin back like skydivin
You live and you got clout, well here's a shout
Maintain balance with your talents
I take it pon myself to send this out

To all you MC's, who don't already know this (FOCUS)
Here's my word of advice, so take it as no diss (FOCUS)

Song:   For Her Souly, Slowly, Solely
Typed by: jgalvan@tws-tag.com

My thoughts are clear
My thoughts are clear

Reminiscing by watching the past
My thoughts are clear
Reminiscing by watching the past pass
My thoughts are clear

Reconciling the opposites
Now colliding divergent forces pulling my entities two ways like indecision
An incendiary split burns like embers
in my coal fire tended with the using of the angels
In my limited vehicle I'm trying to fix my muffler in route to constellations

I determine the sound inside to see if a hundred thousand miles reaches
my earthly toll to the water

I see her with pure peace Symbolic element bi animas evading
Everlasting with colliding and waiting for my energetic key to unlock timelessness
My temporal universe is collapsing in its linear veneer

I believe it is absurd to think that the word could ever capture the pure elements
But I diluted earthly tests to gather measurements for my defense
The fence of parameter permanents ideal life shatters to the unlimited
The next is the two components of yin and yang floating in vacuous space

Their working is for the investigating uncovering experiencing to
release the pure energy which they call love in its place
To replace the astronaut battery grown weak from false projection

Reverse polarity on the attention gathered on focusing on the surface
The self with the selfless repudiates my time travel I unravel before his holiness
Begging at last to be open needing cajoling
or chemical can look into the iris experience naked

In the cavern if you find the jewel of life
and take it with who or what would you replace it?
I have traveled so far hoping my hundred thousand mile foot still
touches the river of earthly waters of reality
Looking out to space to retrace the roots of my original face
to embrace her slowly solely souly

But this whole term is philosophic life becomes kaleidoscopic when
placing the dye of microscopic analyzing on our year of in creation
Building a station upon the atom it's hard to fathom with reason
Measuring the microbe the macro shadow
grows perilously larger than the selfishness of the ego
My subjects are loosing substance
from the recondite space in the experiments I am controlling
Life is inversely larger than scrutiny over sedentary topics
philosophically applied to abstract space
Years ago when my soul started inquiry into this place

The world has moved on
Humanity has moved a million years since
I'm smashing atoms in the cosmic mind
Moms describe me in the same place its all in my mind
I'm traveling space and time looking for the lost pieces of my infant ship
My cast away family past away ambling with age
I destroy energy in reverse polarity enraged

Completely discouraged I forged on to the dark without Captains orders
It's a metaphor for alienation alteration alternating wrong and right
I gather light in order to effect creation

I measure the past while its passing in the river quite an endeavor a
promise to myself to the letter a male cannot deliver
I excise my allegiance to ever and join never in its subtle cynicism
Resigning reclining watching the kaleidoscopic cataclysm and longing for religion
The ousting of my soul fire her manumission is my death life pendulum swinging

The beating of the thugs around her releasing her singing
And she loves me she loves me not
The male order stampedes on galaxies of the destruction and join her cause
All sentiments towards her gifts are a parade of laws

On this planet stranded barren extracting heaven from the one flower left
Call it nostalgic Eden two steps remove heaven
Hell's six I'm gathering living and dieing is seven

To rejoin her slowly souly solely

Driving a hard chakra along the karmic flow throttle the fourth meridian
along the surface looking for signs of heart but there is no life
Awhile under the surface lies team and existence a wealth of information
harboring the beginning

God created heaven and earth
What he detested aligns the trials and test of crucifixion
Ultimately space is abstracted as a cushion
and those astronauts who exist here waiting in the bus station
We have not yet gone to the place where touching God is warranted

There is a warrant out for my testament that is unwanted
I am searching everywhere else for the elements to rejoin the soul
Banging on the window of my astronaut suit
touching my own fingers to get to heaven on earth
Rejoin her slowly souly solely

My thoughts are clear
My thoughts are clear

My thoughts are clear
Reminiscing watching the past
My thoughts are clear
Reminiscing watching the past pass

My thoughts are clear

Chorus *(Swoop G)*

You can shine in yo time

niggas will swear that I never knew you
Ah!

*(Chorus)*

At the Ampa Theatre

I got I got I got nothing to lose (uh ha) and nothing to gain (uh ha)
And nothing from nothing don't leave a God damn thang
I can't win for losin' 
Cause winnin' is strange 
If you were born to be a loser lost and toss in the flame 
But unfortunately what they predicted wasn't so (na uh)
I'm the Lone Wolf addicted to the flow I kicked it once before 
Yeah I got that glow
You know when lights illuminate 
When the atoms and the molecules accumulate I fumigate (HUH)
Catch my sprawled out on the skyline 
When the mother ship crawls out the heavens ya'll won't be hard to find
Yeah I'm out my mind but I'm in yours
Mr. Outsider indoors
I been through the war (yeah) 
I seen many men war tryin' to read they memoirs
Sincerely yours
Mine and hers and his 
Even the cowardly lion is tryin' to find the Wiz
At least I think he is 
But I can save him a trip
Cause I got more courage brains and heartbeat to make sure his don't skip
Cause I'm from Cool World, Water World and the Real World
Worlds of fun and the world has just begun
And is restin' on my shoulders and it ain't no place to run
Now who's house? (WHO'S HOUSE?)
Ace One no doubt
I busted out to my labor of love I stay devot

Verse 2:
I got I got I got height, width, weight (wait) don't forget mass
And class and raps for that ass and lyrical jazz
The inner city slash outer limit pass point of no return 
Pass the joint don't let it burn (hold that)
I learn throughout my term don't be concerned (naw)
With these suckers don't let them latch on
Just keep on travelin' it'll take them way too long, to catch on
To this 
I'ma diss and dismiss those who's suppose to be the bomb
FRONT 
When they got the mic up in they palm
The rap game done changed everybody's on 
We all know someone who flows and rhymin' after long 
So call it what you wanna
I'm a bonafied loner and a stoner
Starvin' like Marvin' and Nona
Still bendin' corners and a proud owner of the skill
To get the whole party poppin' like a pill
I don't stop till 
You had your fill
And till the sunshine starts showin' over the hill
Till I'm over the hill and over the hump
I'm a let my music bump and give the people what they want
Cause I got...

Hook

Verse 3:
I got I got I got showed that the world was cold
People was cold hearted from young to old (spit)
>From old to young from the moon to the sun
>From one to a billion back down to one
I back down to none
Crack down that rum 
I grab the beatbox beat to flip it to 'em have fun
I got my eye on it
He got a three piece suit and a nice tie on it
Might have to fly on it
Go ahead and touch on it 
Taste on it 
Put your face on it
I know you want it but don't got the right component
Yeah I know you want it but don't got the right component
I'm a thunderbird thunderin' flyin' through the air and wonderin' 
Where should I land with this wide wingspan?
But I ended up landin' on the same ship you commandin' 
When I'm through expandin' I'm gonna have the whole world standin' sayin'...

Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Rick Ross]
Ugh, fountain of youth
May our legacies live forever, ugh {Maybach Music}
All my niggaz quiet but we burnin loud
Makaveli to the max, never turn it down
Mac 11 in a Benz: how you like me now?
I run the city so my closet look like Nike Town
Niggaz talkin like bitches, is it my income?
Am I fuckin your bitches? Is it official?
My nigga did a dime, didn't learn a thing from it
Came home in two weeks got him a 600
Get a text from the boss, you know them bricks comin
Chicks at the beach house like they gon' miss somethin
From the churches I rose only lovin the dough
From the Chevy to Rolls, now it's fur on the flo'
Smoke an ounce of the truth, that's my fountain of youth
R.I.P. to Mr. Shakur, this one is for you
Nipsey Hussle and I got my nigga Stalley on it
Double MG burnin out in Cali on it

[Chorus 2X: Nipsey Hussle]
Stained glass window in the Benzo
Lost in the instrumental, keys got me sentimental

[Stalley]
Look - these rap books buried in gold
The treasure of a million men, Versace shades trimmed in gold
My life's big, let them cameras explode
Capture this rags to riches story that I unfold
The youth fountain for the few countin
Made money, but who's countin?
It's hard stuntin livin in subsidized housin
Every bag you bring though the door, dude's countin
And every new girl you bring through, dude's houndin
They want your youth, so they watch your moves
From your pinky ring, down to how you lace your shoes
Rope chains with the precious jewels
The dope game had impression rules
So what they did with cocaine and a couple spoons
had the whole hood actin like goons
Tryin to be the richest, tryin to the be flyest
Claim to be ballin, end up like Len Bias
Screamin from the bottom of this fountain here
Nothin but silence! {M-M-M-M-Maybach Music}

[Chorus]

[Nipsey Hussle]
Uhh, laces in my blue Chucks, represent my bros first
Starin at my Roley bezel as I soul-search
Run this money marathon 'til my soles hurt
But no materials could measure what my soul's worth
I wanted everything, feel like I had no choice
Young niggaz wishin on a star like Rose Royce
Bein honest, killin mommas when we sold work
I made a promise, give me options and I cold turkey
Sick of sittin on the side while it's game point
Recurrin dream, tryin to scream but ain't had no voice
Crazy lady speak in tongues said it's gon' work
Never vocalize my visions, actions was my spokesperson
Study rich niggaz moves like my homework
Sacrilegious however streets was my own church
Stained glass window in the Benzo
Lost in the instrumental, keys got me sentimental look

So I told her I was lookin for the girl of my dreams
And if I didn't find her soon I was gonna scream
Then she looked me in the eyes with a grin on her face
She said, "I think this is the end of your wild goose chase
Let's go for a walk and find a place
Where we can do the right thing until you're blue in the face"

No, luck is not the question or the answer
The brother's too nice, he's just a woman dazzler
Flashing hundreds over there and hundreds over here
When you see him with a lady using savoir-faire

F-r-e-s-h
Fresh, fresh, fresh
Yo, that's fresh

Well I admit there's a place for money and girls
But you need fresh gear to live in this world
Why just the other day I couldn't decide
On which Champs to wear and what Kleins of mine
So with anger on my face I walked out the door
I didn't wanna wear those, I went shopping for more
Lees and Sergios were everywhere
But I needed something new that I could wear
Cause I'm

F-r-e-s-h
Fresh, fresh, fresh
Yo, that's fresh

We're so fresh we don't have to rehearse
We can even rap to you in reverse
( *reversed vocals* )

Yo Jay, I saw you with this girl last night at the jam 
What happened, man?
Word she was looking fly, man
What's up with her?

Well I took her to the crib and started to rap
With the bass that I was throwin she was 'bout to be trapped
Then she said, "Hey lover, let's make that move
To the place to be for lovers so we can prove
That we were made for each other on personal needs
Let's get it started, lover boy, if you know what I mean"
Then we was in the bed together with the stereo on
Doing it to the sound of my favorite song
Cause I'm

F-r-e-s-h
Fresh, fresh, fresh
Yo, that's fresh

Now back to the man with class and razzamatazz
I'm walking down the street with all the ladies in a trance
When you see the brother's back, ooh, the man is ( ? )
To buy this and that, her gear ( ? )
Not only cash dollars but also checks
And when it comes to his status he is always correct
Relaxin in his mansion, wears thick money belts
While he's countin all his money he said to himself
I'm

F-r-e-s-h
Fresh, fresh, fresh
Yo, that's fresh

Sheeepskins and bombers up and down the block
Well time was runnin out as I looked at the clock
And then a girl walked up, she gave a wink
She said, "I bet that your girl could use a new mink"
I agreed with her, she then asked me what size
I said, "You'll do just fine" - I had her hypnotized
I then took her to my crib and with one last yell
I had her and the coat that she tried to sell
Cause I'm

F-r-e-s-h
Fresh, fresh, fresh
Yo, that's fresh

Fresh
That's fresh

[El Da Sensei]
Yo yo yo, huh hah
Smooth diff' in this, y'all know what's goin on with this right here
Yo it's Shawn J., bust it
It's goin down like that
El Da Sensei hah, for the '9-8
F.T., Mike Zoot, Prince Po' huh, Pharoahe Monch
The Frontline, huh
You don't know what's up with this, uhh uhh
You don't know what's up with this
Doin drama like dis do', yo check it out check it out

My vendetta in this form of musical song
is to enlighten and brighten the mind through instrument and rhyme
And fix those inadequate flows that don't adapt
Makin snacks on wax plates for DJs to scratch

[Pharoahe Monch]
Fast slash, cross hatch slash, cross patch
Every word of mine will be verbally so tight to match
That or that I hit you harder than Caterpillar trucks
In the lab where we collaborate or matter will erupt

[Mike Zoot]
From a, music martyr, bust mortar, break the order
Torch your sound texture, fire water's in my aura
Your future forefather, your new wave slave wrapped in chains and amulets
and hard to earn assets

[F.T.]
Yo, niggas game playin but not name sayin
My aim's sprayin, I get mine that's why you stay waitin
and vacatin, whether you know it or not, I'ma blow up the spot
If you owe me a lot, I'ma show up with Glocks

[Prince Poetry]
And you're still wet, pull up your socks, suspend the art
Sizzle like woks, underground spots, from the city to the boondocks
Bounce, double wishbone suspension like shocks
Multiple plans and plots, word

	[Chorus - all]
	You know we shine with rhymes all the time
	Keep in mind don't test these MCs who bless (Word)
	Test these MCs
	You know we shine with rhymes all the time
	Keep in mind don't test these MCs who bless (Word)
	Test these MCs (Word what ugh)
	Test these MCs

[El Da Sensei]
I spit fire satire, indeed bleed, phenomenal demographics
Broadcast my rhyme forecast to eager addicts
Pave a path many can't outlast
Who these cats who blast gats rehearsin lines for a movie cast?
But as a centrail, blaze the track engage
Instamatic sporadic insight pays for days
with their sickening floss, flip on tracks like Dominique Dawes
Pause, date back, flows is gettin flashback

[Pharoahe Monch]
My existence, spirits in animated film, 
three-dimensionally roller scoped
With cloakin devices, skates, stoges and a motor boat
I hold the Pope for ransom, it's
the handsomest, assassinatin Satan, 
leavin the world Marilyn Manson-less
I'm in the streets like Sesame
The recipe - to kill, attain da mil/DeMille like Cecille B.
The rest'll be the aftermath, the most got statistics
Pharoahe Monch, Steve Post about to lift it

[Mike Zoot]
I gotta get mine, give it back so you can get yours

[Prince Poetry]
I gotta get mine, give it back so you can get yours

[Mike Zoot]
I gotta get mine, give it back so you can get yours
Yo yo UHH WHAT

I'm leavin your staff mated, makin these crabs hate it
I lotta fags rate it and thought I got stagnated
I'm not some rap nigga that you're dyin to meet
Just another hungry brother real hungry and tryin to eat
And in the streets you better rely on your feet
Babies is feelin iron, cryin to sleep
Plus the government is supplying the heat
They goin psychotic in prison cos of the economic additions
plus sex and drugs in the bleachers

[F.T.]
3-4 come up, run up in beefcake gun butt-ups
Crush truck chains, the wirey gold frames
chains sums up, the dollars, white collar, blue Range
Eat my dust up, ten in the bucket in the left lane gainin momentum
Cum sendin comers, fair game, a lot of sumtin sumtin
All in or nothin, silence the sufferin
Can't stand the strugglin, some resume games to stain jugglin
I muscled in and scribbled my name

[Prince Poetry]
Belittle your brain, the true grain riddle your frame
Got you forfeitin the bitch by the middle of the game
Hostile, impossible to stop below the free
Buck em down, shook em nothin at the top of the key
Prince, I'm nippatant, magnificent moves, strategic
Smash joints, leavin the track paraplegic
Repeat it for those who need it, niggas catch the vibe
Fish 'n grits, hot sauce, forever embedded inside

	Chorus

[Mike Zoot - Outro]
What, ugh, yo, yeah come on, yeah yeah

(Up to di time) Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, wow!!!

[Verse 1: Jay-Z] + (Pharrell)
Everytime your name was brought up
I would act all nonchalant infront of an audience
Like if you was just another shorty I put the naughty on
But uh, truth be told you do me for a loop, this Hov
I'm too old to be frontin when I'm feeling Denzel
And you acting like you ain't appealing when you are
Stunting like you ain't my only girl when you are (I was just frontin)
I'm ready to stop when you are

[Verse 2: Vybz Kartel]
Jay-Z, Marshall, Kartel and Pharrell Pha-real

Girlfriend your friends and you full of a sex appeal
You have the best for texture feel

Mi a go make you wear a ring like Shaquille O' Neal
Keep it real with me and I'll keep it real, you know

[Verse 3: Wayne Marshall]
Don't be fooled by my glitter and my fame girl
Cause it's you that I really wanna share my name, yeah, my name
Yo, hey, a lot of girls come and go with the hype up
To me you mean more than just one night, yo, one night

* Letters in CAPS mean Wayne Marshall is singing with Pharrell

[Chorus: Pharrell & Wayne Marshall]
I know that I'm carrying on, never mind if I'm showing off
I WAS JUST FRONTIN (you know I want ya babe)
I'm ready to bet it all, unless you don't care at all
BUT YOU KNOW I WANT YA (you should stop frontin babe)

[Verse 4: Vybz Kartel]
Listen, and you will hear wedding bells in my ear
Reception in Spain honeymoon in Zaire
Mi need yuh fi breed by di end of this year
Of if you girl fi mi brighten my world fi mi
This isn't comedy like Fresh Prince of Bel Air
Mi serious when mi tell yuh seh mi love and mi care
True, and if yuh willin share
Double king size bed deh yah, wid di linen fit here

Don't be fooled by my glitter and my fame girl

Pullin niggas apart like bammer weed, takin em for their 3-fifty
Hit the corner of Watt and Whitney, that's where that green shit be
Fifty sack and i'm out with a bitch that I don't know
About to hit the momo back to lose a ho gain a ho

Whether i'm livin out my momma house or in the back of my whatchamacallit

Get me another one of them faulty bitches pervin off the ole 8 brew
Then what you do, I smile in they face
Then leave they muthafuckin body in a casketcase

Dig'em a ditch then stick the bitch

Man, you sure you're gettin money, B you ain't gettin a dime
Y'all niggas is petty crooks, snatchin chains and pocket books
Who you been wit? (Jive ass, money-go motherfuckers)
In this ghetto jurisdiction, some niggas are solid, while others are
science fiction
Well respected, I'm connected to the roots and the trees, me familia's
thick
Flippin ki's, dangerous, stay on top of broken ank-les
Kickin ghetto wit spang-les, so all places new to the game
MVP's down to earth, niggas talkin 'bout ki's
They gotta grab theirs first while my crew sittin
sippin Cristal, puffin spinach in my villa
Money Boss nigga, bigger than your biggest coke dealer
We be the outspoken, no one hoes like calibre
Metal like Metallica, so cock your Mac 11's if your wit me
You ain't sellin shit and you ain't doin shit
You kills me, coke's is steppin stones to big cars and homes
Impress me and buy a half brick o' D
Uptown NY, makin MVP's

(There's only three ways out, so how you wanna play?)

Chorus:

If it ain't real, it ain't right
Grown men playing teenage games
Don't gotta say no names
Musicians wanna be gangstas
Gangstas wanna be musicians
Two sides on all positions
So be what you witness

My everyday, seen a pocket full of green
As the sun beams on the QB and make it gleam
C notes and half Amir's, break off and rubber bands
Jump and touch a class window, blacked out, black era
Is there a common wealth? Twistin up a 20 for delf
If your AG's then seize my peeps with the wealth
All players, big willies, big spenders and hustlers
Dice game, Five-0 break it up, wanna ????
Make some moves with this crab nigga
I knew he was a fake nigga
Got knocks, snitched up, switched up
Started turning state, caught a case
and I thought court offenders make the best story sayers
Money Boss Players

Chorus

So you's a hustler, you ain't a hustler, you's a gangsta
I bet'cha, and if you had cash would I sweat'cha?
You're buggin, my street dialect ain't soggin
Absolute, no jive, aiyo busters start in five
Don't fuck with them and those cos they shallow
Chocolate weed be on my breath coppin Nike Air apparell
Comin thru blocks, rippin shit up like a vandal
We all can't play, some of us face sport and Kangol
Roll dice, I'm nice, sippin half pints of courage
I heard, sellin coke is the only way to flourish
If the God ain't got it, the God ain't spendin
Po' niggas still po', them niggas they livin splendid

          We tearin' it up
          We bringing it rough
          And we don't give a fuck
          This is straight up
[Both]    Gangsta love
[Down]    For all my eses that are
          All bald
          Taking your wifeys and taking a car
          Or sitting in the kitchen
          Cooking cookies in the yard
          This is strictly for the doggies
          In San Quintin, sittin' behind bars
          With thirteen bullets, (?) just seen it all
          Walking the yard with shags, ready to brawl
          This is for all y'all
          From the bottom of my heart
          Gangsta shit
          And that's ours

Chorus: Fingazz
That gangsta shit
As you ride up and down the eastside (Yeah)
For the one time homie
It's the C-O, L-O, N-I-A
Motherfucker, we don't play games
This is that gangsta shit
As you ride up and down the eastside (Bitch)
For the one time homie
It's the C-O, L-O, N-I-A

[Down]
Down
Down
I'm Down

(Verse 2)
[Down]    I'm the type of dawg that loves to look good
[Fingazz] And not like those bitches that do what they should
[Down]    Bring you 501's .48's
          With the chrome gun, representing the hood
          Sitting on a brand new ride, so it's all good
[Fingazz] You know it's all good in Cali
[Down]    I was hanging out this one afternoon
          Getting all brewed
          Eating some dog food
          I was rollin' through the hood
          Bumping some old school
          Puffing on a bamboo, feeling like a player should
          This is for the tailors that bumpin' the Kenwood
          And for my gang
          That's dressed in all blues
          Sitting on chrome shoes, ready to stick a move
          Looking sharper than a zoo suit
          Going on a limo cruise, chugging on the deuce-deuce
          Gone with some evil loc's, lookin' for the prostitutes

Repeat Chorus

Hook: Fingazz
No, you can't stop the gang from bangin' on ya
Cause you're too hard up in Oxnard, California
And motherfucker, yes, I tried to warn ya
You can't stop that gangsta shit
No

(Verse 3)
[Down]    I broke the handcuffs and loaded my gun
[Fingazz] And if you step inside the wretched, you're gonna get thugged
[Down]    I put the blunt to my lips and fired it up
[Fingazz] Smoke the whole damn thing, then we roll another one
[Down]    I got hoes lined up
          Ready to fuck
          So I called up my dawgs, so I hit the rugs
          It's on, doggie
          Take your leash off
          Tell your hoe you'll be back, and drop that bitch off
          Turn all communications up
          And let's get it on
[Fingazz] Baby, let's get it on, til the break of dawn
[Down]    It was 9'o clock
          Wrapped up a session in the studio
          And shooked the spot
          Locked the low-low in the air, about four knobs
          Thinking like I'm drinking, throwin' signs at the top
          Leaving the block
          Thinking about pussy
[Fingazz] L-O, V-In'
[Down]    And getting a blowjob

Repeat Chorus

[Intro: Eddie Talking]
This is a service public announcement
It's goin' out to all the paper haters
Now sure sure sure your broke, sure sure sure your havin' problems
Food stamps didn't come on time and the lights have been cut off
But look here
 
[Snoop Doggy Dogg]
Here's a little somethin' about a nigga like me "What's that?"
I never should have been let out the penitentiary
Snoop Dogg, would like to say
That I'ma crazy mothafucker when I'm playin' with my A.K.
Since I was a youth, I smoked weed out
Now I'm that mothafucker y'all read about
Smokin' you and your crew, takin' a life or two
You don't like how I'm livin, well fuck you
This is my gang, nigga, No Limit
My nigga C will fuck you up in a minute
With the pow pow, bang bang (*gun shots*) and you're dead
And then we stamp that Tank on your forehead
Every where we go they say "DAMN"
Them gangsters, they be fuckin' up the program
And then you realize we don't care
We don't just say no, we to busy sayin' yeaaaahhhhhh
About drinkin' straight out the seven bottle
Do I look like a mothafuckin' role model?
To a kid lookin' up to me
Shit, life ain't nothin' but weed and money
Shit, I'm that type of nigga that's quick to blast
Fuck with me or C and I'll put my foot in your ass
I don't give a fuck cause I keep sellin'
Yo, what the fuck are the yellin?
 
[Chorus: Snoop Doggy Dogg]
"Gangsta Gangsta" that's what they're yellin'
Niggaz livin' rowdy and stay bout it, bout it
"Gangsta Gangsta" that's what they're sellin'
The bitches want to buy it, cause they love that straight G shit
 
"Gangsta Gangsta" that's what they're yellin'
Niggaz livin' rowdy and stay bout it, bout it
"Gangsta Gangsta" that's what they're sellin'
The bitches straight buyin' it, cause they love that straight G shit
 
[Snoop Doggy Dogg]
Homies all standin' around just hangin'
Some dope dealin, some gang bangin' "what up nigga?"
We decide to roll a week deep
Seen a nigga on Dayton so we creep
Real slow, and before you know
I had my double pointin' at his window
He got scared and hit the gas "Damn"
Right then, I knew I had to smoke his ass
He kept rollin, I jumped in the bucket
We couldn't catch him, so I said fuck it
Then we headed right back to Snukes
Sweatin' all the bitches in the Daisy Dukes
We couldn't no play, from the ladies
With seven niggaz in a Navs, bitch you crazy?
She was scared and it was showin'
So we all said "FucK YOU Bitch" and kept rollin'
To the hood, now we was fin to
Find somethin' else to get into
Like some pussy, or in fact
Gettin' rowdy, shit but we call it rat pack
On a nigga follow nothin' at all
Snoop Dogg gets ignorant when I'm fuckin' with my Tank dogs
I might stumble and still won't lose
Now I'm draped in my gangsta blues
Cause I'm the type of nigga that's quick to blast
Fuck with me or C and I'll blast your ass
See, I don't give a fuck cause I keep bailin'
Yo, what the fuck are they yellin?
 
[Chorus: Snoop Doggy Dogg]
"Gangsta Gangsta" that's what they're yellin'
Niggaz livin' rowdy and stay bout it, bout it
"Gangsta Gangsta" that's what they're sellin'
The bitches want to buy it, cause they love that straight G shit
 
[Break: Snoop Doggy Dogg]
Hold.. hold on Craig, B cut that shit man
Mothafuck that man, we need some gangsta in this motherfucker 
Some of that South shit, you know what I'm sayin?
Some of that shit from the thiz-ird source, you heard me?
 
Here's another gangsta down to ride
A T-shirt and Levi's is his only disguise
He represents the Tank, yet hard to hit
Snoop Dogg and C-Murder with this gangsta shit
 
[C-Murder]
Well, I'm C-Murder the one he talkin' about
Nigga tried to play me close and got punched in the mouth
Fed's tried to get me, you know they some haters
I said "See you later" jumped in the Navigator
With the $50's in the back, with the Navy blue top
True niggaz on the scene with the triple beam
Cause I'm the C fool, I slang and Snoop bang
And I'll smoke a mothafucker like it ain't no thing
To all my bitches, I know your jockin' my crew
"We want to fuck you C"
I want to fuck you too
You see, No Limit niggaz don't take no shit
So let me tell you motherfuckers who you fuckin' with
Cause I'm the kind of nigga that's quick to blast
If you fuck with me, I'ma smoke your ass
I don't give a fuck cause No Limit stay sellin'
Now tell me, what the fuck are they yellin?
 
[Chorus: Snoop Doggy Dogg]
"Gangsta Gangsta" that's what they're yellin'
Niggaz livin' rowdy and stay bout it, bout it
"Gangsta Gangsta" that's what they're sellin'
The bitches want to buy it, cause they love that straight G shit
 
[Outro: Eddie Talking]
If you would just stayed down and been the motherfuckers real partner 
You wouldn't have had that problem
But seein, as you want to jump ship and you thought the ship would sink
A motherfucker without turnin' into a submarine
Went under water came back up with a periscope lookin' at your bitch ass
Now, you have no paper, and now you're on a paper caper
Now, you comin' up to my face and you're sayin: Hey can I hang out? 
I say: No cause you ain't got no clout, bitch get out
Now, I'm tired of all these silly ass mothafuckin' paper chasin' whores
Uhh, this has been a public service announcement from No Limit Records

Song:   Good Enough
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I gave you all of me
But it still ain't enough to make you happy
I gave you everything
It still don't measure up
It feels like I walked 5 thousand miles
And didn't even come close
Feels like I try to make you smile
But you don't even care, no

I'll never be big enough to pay your dues
But I keep trying
And you just keep on making me jump through hoops
What do I got to do?

I just want you to look at me
And see that I can be worth your love
I just want you to look at me
And see that I can be
Good enough, good enough
Good enough
And see that I can be
Good enough, good enough
Good enough

I try to show you that I'm strong
Why do I even bother?
Cause it's the same old damn song
And you call yourself a father
Feels like I'm reaching for the stars
But heaven isn't letting me
I wish that I had longer arms
But I know that will never be never be

I'll never be big enough to pay your dues
But I keep trying
And you just keep on making me jump through hoops
What do I got to do?

I just want you to look at me
And see that I can be worth your love
I just want you to look at me
And see that I can be
Good enough, good enough
Good enough
And see that I can be
Good enough, good enough
Good enough

Look at me
I'm standing right here waiting for you, here I am
Look at me
Lookin' for your acceptance, do you give a damn?
Look at me
See it doesn't matter what you think, I'm still a man
Look at me
Open up your eyes, can't you see that I'm good enough

I just want you to look at me
And see that I can be worth your love
I just want you to look at me
And see that I can be
Good enough, good enough
Good enough
And see that I can be
Good enough, good enough
Good enough

[Intro: William Cooper (Killah Priest)]
(Yea pass that) *Sniffin' Weed*
Word up, word up, word up, haha!
That shit feel good right? 'Knaw'mean? (Yea)
GemStar The Regime straight up!
Black Market The Revolution (Yea)
Both sides of the coin (Exoticness)
You understand what we talkin' 'bout? (uh huh)
We givin' y'all fair warnin'

[Tragedy Khadafi]
Hot lead bust through iron pipes
Blood drip from the corner of a young thug's mouth
The hood life, is torn flesh
And his last bit of breath, pulses over dead flesh
Homicide hover like Vultures
Married the game, now the Earth's dirty and indulges
Should of seen him though
Niggaz though his heart was the coldest
Left two seeds, little son Rod was the oldest
Two baby mothers, blowin' guns duckin' under covers
And his motto was, no one in this whole world love us
From the Womb to the Tomb, presume the youth's scars
Soul on ice, tears of a killer behind bars
When you curse God, streets is a gangsta's graveyard
My advice, in the meantime to you is play hard
It's real, when you deal with the cards you dealt
It's not real, when your seeds feel the pain you felt
Break the curse Disciple nigga paved the way
It ain't gangsta when your seeds go lay in the same grave
You die in the same hood, bleed on the same corner
The game's over, all of my niggaz have fair warnin'
Yea fair warnin', symbolize life

[Killah Priest]
My rhymes a guideline for political thugs and O.G.'s
We blow trees in front of authorities not givin' a fuck
Revolvers will squeeze regardless to the warrants you read
Trauma we bleed, before they put our wrists in them cuffs
I sit in the cut like I'm '62, an ex-Panther
Narrator, screen writer for niggaz in handcuffs
Gangstas are freedom fighters doin' life in the slammers
Where the strangers take advantage when they tie our bandanas
And I Thank You, wit the knife 'til we collide wit 'em hammers
Phantoms they talk to me seldom
Cats yell from they gut they shells come and their skeletons struck
How I survive that .4 - .5, well, I tell 'em it's luck
Felons erupt at chow time, shots heard from a loud .9
Fitted Turbans we feast and beneath her loud signs
I don't care if your Crip or you Blood
When cops come, get rid of them drugs
For Revolution grab that mask, pistol, and glove
This is the love, Black oils richer than blood
I'm sick of the grudge, between Vice Lords and G.D.'s
Latin Kings and Mieta's, it's that real shit, that hood lecture

[William Cooper]
Your future's outlined in chalk, when you tangle with dope
And few know what they riskin' 'til eventually choke
I put them flames to the smoke your body leaks 'til y'all soap
Black Market's the vault, now we that uncooked coke
That smuggled in on boats, dippin' DEA coats
Poppin' up like toast, so don't play me too close
The FBI and the Mob be like the Bloods and the Crips
Seems like the root of all evil leads to Government chips
It's better to slip with the foot, then slip with the tongue
Flash both sides of the coin, then the Ying and Yang forms
Keep it straight, Black and White, wit no gray in my zone
Stand on top of my word, what I gave is my soul
So who do I owe? Dug myself up out of a hole
And while y'all fightin' for Gold, I fight the NWO
Since twelve years old, I'd known where to get a burner
Because the breath of the Devil, have you huggin' the corner
Word up!

[Hook: Killah Priest] *2X*
And in the hood, we spit 'GemStars'
Givin' you fair warnings, for life Lectures
Puttin' holes in your Texture
Only two ways to go - Parole or the Stretcher
We'd rather be on our thrones, holdin' our Scepters

Leave you shot for dead, nigga I'll rot your flesh
By myself come for delf and just pop your head
Now have a good night you snake skin bastard
See you at the crossroads faggot
And in the mean time and in between time
Pee will be layed up with more shines, more dollars for more nines
More boxes of talons to put in your spine
You cross me nigga you lost your mind
Scratch that you never knew from the start
So I forgive you, after you die squirmish, shots burneth

Son we chose life fast, and niggaz kept stuntin'
Had to show our ass straight up explode right fast

Rippin' rats finished off our path, we was close like that
All them nights that we threw back yak
Who would thought he do me like that straight leave me flat
Niggaz ain't never feed me black, wanna see me clap
Blood filling up the cement crack
Straight snakes and I resent that I fall back try to prevent that
Try not to be bent at, foul atmosphere
Stunning what's happening here
Got me 'bout to dumb out dumping out Macs in here
Niggaz catch a hot one, fucking with Am this year
Wet every man in here vengence lost my senses
Y'all start quarrels I end it
And show up at your wake full of sorrow pretending
To blend in

Yo I blow holes in ?moschinos?, splash niggaz in they mink ?stoles?
Down to their Kenneth Coles, fuck model bitches center fold
Never love a hoe, you got guns let it go my nigga let it blow
And what had killed you is what you don't know
It's two-five goodfellas gettin' dough
Yo my mom chose dope made love to the needle
I caught 'em fuckin numerous times and turned evil
Back in '89 you can say I'm trapped in tme
Still thirsty like a little nigga dying to sihne
Baby moms said I got issues, too many problems
I rock timbs 'til my socks turn orange
Do a nigga dirty, relate to the unworthy
A young G with Q-T and black shirty
I've been nice since lee pin stripes and britsh knights
Fore' building razor tag and sword fights
Niggaz see the light when they start losing pints
You can die by the gun or the knife
And I'm nice with both, coming at me with the wrong approach
Don't make me Arab neck tie your throat, you bitch nigga!!

(Prodigy Hook: To Fade)
Thun the get back, is so sweet

What's up y'all, you heard me
Master P in this bitch, I'ma introduce y'all
To my lil homie, his name Fire
He bout to get y'all real fucked up
With this gangsta shit

[Fire]
The buddah sack, circulates through the chest
Puts the mind to rest, fresh from everyday stress
In the West, that's why I pack a tech and strap my vest
Flex nothing less, than optimoes or it gots to go
Cause y'all hoes, don't know this nigga well
I like to get blowed, and rocks what I sell
As I dwell through the home, of the Sac, but ain't nobody
Passing up the potent, watch a nigga jump up on it
If you want it nigga get it, hit it
Inhale exhale, then bail through the angel's spell

[Hook]
I'm getting higher, off that fire
We got the blunts and optimoes, we coming shy brah
I'm getting blowed we getting blowed, so let's get blowed together
Let's put a five up on the dime, and hit it with the fellas

[Fire]
I got the Regal with the D's and Vogues, for them skeezing hoes
Legal when I roll, because I stash a stack in the dough
Don't be a hoe, because your hoe chose me
But most be, only they think I'm selling OZ's
Cause hoes see the gold teeth, and fresh pair of baggies
Got the fade down, and there ain't no got the off it in Cali
Up in the alley's where they from, nobody of that nigga who got he jacked
Put the bullets in his back, for trying to take my sack
No slack is cut, when nuts be tested
Ingested with herb smoke, from that West bitch

[Hook]

I'm getting higher, off that fire
We got the blunts and optimoes, we coming shy brah

[Fire]
The chrome is mine, I holds a nine for those times
When niggaz commit crimes, like armed robbery I'm
Trying to get my mind right, and the rhyme tight tonight
So that I might, make it to the lime light
On a flight to the top, with endo in the cockpit
Fuck that rock shit, let the fiends jock it
I got some ends up in my pocket, and I'm bout it bout it
If you can stop the Fire cess, nigga I doubt it doubt it
Because I'm down with the South click, got clout with
Them playas from the Oak Town, so let's smoke now

(*inhaling, exhaling, choking*)

Running your mouth and snitching, get you clapped with the iron

In my hood, everything is a crime
I know 8 year olds, with cell phones, crack, vest and a nine
On they own, invested in time, call Murda for work
Sha let you invest in the dime
I'm the bud in the Dolce Gabana, fitted hat
Eyeslow still puffing, while I'm gripping the llama
Yeah, these niggas don't want no drama
How I got heavy artillery and too much armor
Drug kids get smacked and run to your mama
Niggas don't want it, man, I'm quick with the llama
Mopping you, you so soft, fit for the drama
I'm the period, nigga, you the slash and the comma, yeah

[Chorus 2X]

[D.C.]
That boy, be the type to handle my business
Making cowards roll over like cellular minutes
If it's a club, you can tell when we in it
In the back wit the mack and the twenty sack, inhaling the spinach
D.C.'s one hell of a nigga
Cuz you can catch me anytime, anyplace, like a felony, nigga
Practice booth, I spit til I crack this booth
Crack a smile til I crack your tooth, that's the truth
Why I got D.C. here to carry the torch
Put your brains in the bag and let you carry your thoughts
And nah, I ain't your average sport
I went form bankrupt to bankroll, four-five-sixes til the bank close
Chain block, save the same musician in the same quote
Getting cheddar, ducking the same po's, in plain clothes
Tim Brown, little brown brother, let the pound stutter
Rounds flooded you clowns, utter the Don say I'm gutter

[Chorus 2X]

[King Just]
Speak when spoken too, I'm not you
Plus you can't do, what I can do
Lose you in thoughts, with all types of source
Park Hill, east barricks, holding the fort
Teach what is taught, and show support
K.J., here to save the day, I relit the torch
Hope the competition steps it up
Cash Rule, why you think in God we trust?
Build your house, while I build my community
I rock the emblem upside down, for the mutinity
Future of the industry, and you ain't got to feel me
Simile Himalayas, source like Eric B.
Open sesame, you won't get the rest of me
The street be stressing me to come out immediately
So I drop, make it hot on the spot
We gon' bump this shit, whether you like it or not

[Chorus 2X]

[Leathafase]
This is the Killzone, my nine mil drills through domes
And then spins you similar to 26 inch chromes, holmes
Your bones is made of foam, your jaws made of glass
And your veins pump cherry Kool-Aid, bitch nigga, you ass
Bitch tripping the glass table, the weight so enormous
Law enforcements study my picture perfect painted portraits
Guns are gorgeous, my tongue sharper than a swordfish be
Crispy clear, til the airs, the fear factor
Ran rapper, heart colder than the continent of Antarctica
Dominant when I blam the launcher
Son, I'm amped enough to conquer a whole project block
Or more longer that'll dump off in your hardest cops
Soon as I let the pump off, the target is marked
These pellets scattered in your heart means X marks the spot
I got bitches who suck dick like it was National Sperm Day
You get murdered in broad day by my ratchet through word play

The hoes get naked soon as the song come on
The niggaz get wreckless, it's off the chain here gone
It's poppin speakers knockin crowded off on the flo'
They jockin it, watchin when I walks through the do'
It's him, tell a friend but you already know
Act stupid or lose it, don't bother to fuck with Quo
I'm kind of different, he's not the usual
Sippin Cognac in between two beautiful
bitches in the club, talk shit it's your funeral
I came to get a buzz and crunk, understand?
It's crowded, it's packed, it's jumpin - goddamn it's swole
I'm cooler than cool as my temperature's - 30 below
I'm checkin the scene if a new cut - droppin the low
Shakin they ass, backin it up – fast or slow (YEA!)

[Chorus: Stat Quo]
You know this thang don't stop 'til I say so
Now get low – get low, keep that ass on the flo'
You know this club don't close 'til I say so

And as far as all y'all who be actin tough

We ready, we sweaty, it's hot - it's off the chain
We mackin, excuse me miss, tell me what's your name
The way you move in them jeans make me happy you came
I'm tryin to get to know you, possibly get some brain
I may pick your brains, I'm the man of your dreams
You like me you wanna be wifey and join my team
So I can sport you and support you by any means
Nah, I ain't givin you none of my thangs
But we can leave the club tonight, hit the telly and fuck
Long as you know when I bust - I'm in the dust
Ain't no chillin, it ain't nothin for us to discuss
Except what time your ride pickin you up (YEA!)

[Chorus]

[Stat Quo]
Yeah, yeah

Do somethin girl, touch the ground (YEA!)

Artist: Black Wine
Album:  One Million Strong
Song:   Get Up
Typed by: davpaul@dove.net.au

Intro:

Yeah ha ha, I am Big Shot your neighbourhood bawla baby (Schyeah!)
Puttin it down for these Black Wine pimps, ya hear?
(Cos it's all about the scrilla, stayin on the for realla,
y'knowhutI'msayin?)
And don't nuthin move but the money, so forget what they tell you,
y'knowI'msayin?
Game is short not tall 
(Cos it's all about the money in the land of milk and money)

Chorus:

Get up off your butt
You gotta get the loot, you gotta get a cut
of that pie because they teared it up
So bad and cheap for the rest, give it up, say what?
(Cos it's all about the money in the land of milk and money)
*repeat*

Verse 1:

Well if one times four equals four all mine
It be them G's or them *?creaks?* that begin one line
So find me livin it up as you walk thru that one way-ly
See me in that wild wild west
where shadows aren't wanted so don't even come
cos ain't nuttin but a black thing where I'm from
I see the police and wish they be deceased
So lock your own self up because your just as crooked as me
Who could it be? The mystery's known so why she say that
Hoe raped the stick from the vanyard yesterday
They got away, which way? Where they be travellin?
How many sips of the Black Wine'll keep ya babblin
But still managin to do everything fine
And didn't I blow your mind this time
So pack it up, pack in and pick it up, see what it's about
It's BB and a G and a G - BB and I am out, so yeah

Chorus (x1/2)

Verse 2:

I'm hoppin outta bed at a half-past 9
The Sactown sunshine gotta player feelin fine
and refreshed, I'm back into my quest for ends
but when you think it's over then I just begin
You're walkin on a thin line frontin with Black Wine
You imitators covered cos we're genuine
About as real as authentic, G's represented
coast to coast now who got it pocket, West Coast

All you pimps who got dissed, come on in but don't you fiend
We rock this like some dope now you can scrape it off your screen
Lord knows how many flows it take
to get you caught up witta mack almost every day
Cos players networkin all around the clock
tryin to move a couple crates of this motherfuckin fresh stock
of Black Wine, niggas get erbed off mine
So when I hit you with this 40 watch your blindside (Right)

Chorus

Bridge:

So if you're stackin all the cash and coppin all the dough
If you're bawlin like a player then let a brother know
(That's right! That's right!)
(Cos it's all about the money in the land of milk and money)
So if you're stackin all the cash and coppin all the dough
If you're livin like a bawla and you're outta control
Say that's right! That's right!
(Cos it's all about the money in the land of milk and money)

Verse 3:

Live out the cellar, Black Wine you can't fade
Niggas bawl then they fall in the game cos they bitch made
Now we gon' take control of this shit today
You think you're laced up wit crank cos we keep y'all amped
I try to fold some paper, maintain scrill
Hustle up a mill, put tweed in my grill
(So you can be a hustler like you're s'posed ta be)
Black mobbed down South set constantly
It's for the money man so get this scrilla 'fore it's gone
Niggas slippin in the game, don't get too long
I got to be at dat then an actor to this shit
So when I put it down in your town it's a hit
I stay in ten, I keep it twisted up like braids
And high-powered times, high-powered rhymes get paid
Black Wine til I die, black mind for life
Do it all for the scrill, stay on point like a knife

Chorus x2

Interlude: *man talking*

Get up off your butt...

Artist: Idle Warship (Talib Kweli & Res)
Album:  The Man with the Iron Fists O.S.T.
Song:   Get Your Way (Sex as a Weapon)
Typed by: Cno Evil

[sample]
Men, may have always held the power
The power is a fickle mistress
The nature of power is that it belongs to no one
Until it is taken, seized, seized through sex
Violence, gold...

[Talib Kweli]
They say sex is a weapon, so when I shoot
Meet your death in less then eight seconds
Uh, they say sex is a weapon, so when I shoot
Meet your death in less then, uh
Sex is a weapon, so when I shoot
Meet your death in less then eight seconds
Sex is a weapon, so when I shoot
I'mma sex shooter, I take aim and let it go
A dictator, the best ruler you ever know
So dominant, that I promise to shake your confidence
I sponsor you with a scholarship, school you, I got a doctrine
In the simulation, if necessity is the mother of invention
Then lust is the father of innovation
Uh, they got together and raised the nation
Birth of civilization, first it hurt then it was amazing

[Chorus: Res]
Packing heat and taking aim, ain't not need
You need you gon' get your way
Popping shit and spitting game, but there's no need
You know you gon' get your way

[Talib Kweli]
Submission is the mission when I'm building and destroying
My methods, the Christ suggested when I'm employing the coitus
The joy, you can't avoid, it's joyous, upset your voided
The moisture that deploying is taking us on a voyage
I'm trying to find your spot, but your wetter than a tsunami
Shaping it like she paper, I twist her like origami
Organically grown, known to give orgasms
Til organisms with ex chromosomes
I'm taking her home, one thing about her, she probably don't know her power
To eat a clam like it's chowder, I'm bombing the lotus flower
She can't fake it cuz I know the face
She on top cuz she know her place
See your place, ain't the same as your position
Why you racing, it ain't a competition
Cuz you already been declared the winner
Now get up and prepare my dinner

[Chorus]

[Interlude: Res]
Why you playing me like I'm a toy
You twisting my mind...
But I'm a woman, and if there's anything I know
I know sex is a weapon
And it could hurt you
To the strongest of me, deep down
And never forget, yeah
You can have anything you want
You don't gotta even get all like that, baby
You can have it if you want it

[Chorus 2X]

We bringing hat on niggaz baby, know I'm saying
All that plexing get pushed to the side, know I'm saying
Cause it's going down up in here, ain't nothing but a bunch of chilling
Going on, know I'm tal'n bout for real, sliding off to it

[Hook - 2X]
Throw your hood up high, (go on get em up)
If you balling for real, (eye to eye nigga what)
Let the broke stay broke, (man we hustling fa sho)
No need to say mo', (if it ain't about do')

[A3]
For all my niggaz, running the game
Cause this is the reign to bring pain, loving it mayn
It's a strain to the brain, when you struggling for change
Life in the fast lane, hustling till the cash came
If you get it then you got it, if you don't then you won't
Playa before you want, figure out the do's and don'ts
I'ma give it to ya, the way it's 'pose to be gave
Automatic brigade, niggaz gon bleed hey
This world made to be paid, by winners losers and cheaters
I live in the land on, for body bags and bleeders
Mugs catch slugs, you hustling or you thug
Up coming up out the mud, niggaz throw your hands up

[Hook - 2X]

[D-Reck]
We cock-cock (knock-knock), and unlock the do'
(one pop) one drop, now hit the flo'
Now wave em high (to the sky), so all eyes can see
Who the hell making mail, where my ballers be
This ain't a Jelly-Jam Broham, when he entered the spot
Shocked and rocked nonstop, while the champagne pop
Hit the do' front and center, iced up like winter
That shoe-shoe and loo-ooing, when they chick and us
If you making that money, and you getting that do'
Represent your hood, and let these motherfuckers know
This our sight's not nice, just to keep it nice
Don't do our stance, this is man and mic
And I might entice, her to spend the night
But she gotta be a winner, work her thizzle right

[Hook - 2X]

[A3]
Just take a second and pause, some of these niggaz be pretending to ball
Hollin' out they got it all, (ay can I spit) hell naw
Making excuses trying to throw you off, simple and plain
Don't believe the words out of niggaz mouth, watch what you talk
Some haters, hover just like a hawk
You find yourself in the situation, that they done brought
Killing your name, niggaz twisted in the rap game
Phony busters is side swiping, for fortune and fame
I maintain, keep tripping and get caught slipping
Don't think a playa won't click ya, commits to chest ripping
I'm one of the best at what I do, when I do what the hell I come to do
You don't wanna see the 3 let loose, with the tool

Typed by: jostmatt at bluewin dot ch (send corrections to typist)

Get off
Get off
Get off my tip

[ Pebblee Poo ]
KC, you did me wrong, I wanna talk to you
Just running in the streets, you know the rent is due
Then took my money to cold fill your head
But if I don't see 300 in 2 you're dead

[ Keith KC ]
Now baby, don't break, wait a minute, hold up
Stop coming out your mouth, girl, enough is enough
You can talk about the mortgage and throwing me out
But you always come looking for me, that's no doubt

[ Pebblee Poo ]
Ah-ah, don't play me out, don't even try to pretend
Come and get your clothes, baby, spend a night with your friend
Let the doorknob hit you where the dog shoulda bit you
If you keep talking mess, then my brothers will get you

[ Keith KC ]
Well you can't throw me out, I was leaving anyway
You made a meat loaf that tasted like clay
When I come in late I want a homecooked meal
Not a ( ? ) sandwich and banana peel

[ Pebblee Poo ]
You should be eating clay for what I've been through
I feel like I'm the keeper at the neighborhood zoo
When I come home from work sauce is on the floor
And the funk is greeting me at my door

[ Keith KC ]
Hello Pebblee, come and have a seat
[ Pebblee Poo ]
You know what? Garbage trucks smell like your feet
[ Keith KC ]
Stop screaming and shouting and having a fit
Just stop bugging on me, girl, and get off my tip

Get off
Get off
Get off my tip

[ Keith KC ]
Now that you calmed down, let me talk to you
See I knew for a fact that the rent was due
Now about the money, I take the blame
Because I lost fifty dollars betting on the game
I bought sneakers, pants and a sheepskin hat
And a new goose-down to put on my back

[ Pebblee Poo ]
( ? ), don't give me that
You had at least spent 50 dollars on some crack
[ Keith KC ]
Now you're yelling again, not tryina see it my way
You ask me for money almost every day
You see I need things too, that you must admit
Why don't you be a real woman and not counterfeit?
Stop screaming and shouting and having a fit
Just stop bugging on me, girl, and get off my tip

Get off
Get off
Get off my tip

[ Pebblee Poo ]
Ask you for money, on a mission from God?
You never had a crooked dollar, let alone a job
Telling all your friends that I'm easy to please
When you know from the get you never had the keys
Now if I was so easy we can deal with proof
Let's see who gon' be living under this roof

[ Keith KC ]
Let's drop it
[ Pebblee Poo ]
You're on it
[ Keith KC ]
Get off it, doggone it
[ Pebblee Poo ]
Just like the Green Hornet
[ Keith KC ]
You know that you want it
[ Pebblee Poo ]
KC, I should slap you way cross town
Grab you by your nappy hair and throw you down
Every morning six months you never comb your hair
If it wasn't for me you'd be on welfare
[ Keith KC ]
Talking 'bout my hair, you got a lotta nerve
You got mad extensions and wigs on reserve
And you wonder why I never take you out?
The roaches call your head a honeycomb hideout

(Come to the honeycomb hideout now)

[ Pebblee Poo ]
Oh you tryina ( ? ) with that stitch on your lip
That you got when I slashed you with my bruised fist
( ? ) just the other day
Your ( ? ) the table and ran away
Enough of this talk, we're too close for that
I wanna talk about the Poo as I start to rap
I'm about being cool yes, and don't you forget
They call me Pebblee Poo, the Poo, the best out yet
Never tryina play post high and that's a fact
I just dress to impress cause I got it like that
Never tryina be cool and never speak your mind
Got to be like the Poo, be one of a kind
Got the money, get loose, hah, give it a boost
Got to be like the two and get all the best juice
If you ever thought the Poo couldn't rock the mike
Take heed to what you thought, I can make your night
Make your head diddy-bop, Poo is never a flop
Cause I'm the queen of the flock, I make you boogie non-stop

[ Keith KC ]
Now you got it, Pebblee, I don't wanna beef
I just wanna lounge out and feel relief
I wanna grab a lady and start to play
And if I pick one up tonight this is what I'd say:
Hello lovely lady, tell me how do you do?
I got something new for you and your crew
To listen to, yeah, while we do the do
And if you wanna you can dance as I start the boogaloo
I don't want you to think that I be running a scam
So I let you know right now who I am
I be the super-duper ( ? )
Known to everybody as a microphone trooper
Name is KC when I start to rock
MC's run and hide cause they know they get clocked
Before we get loose I tell you this straight up
I'm the original, I am not a MC duck
So if you wanna ( ? )
If you try don't mess around, I have to take you out
Like this

Album:  Rap Essentials 2000
Song:   Gimme 5 Mics
Typed by: brians@compusmart.ab.ca

Aiyo, it's the Concentration Camp
The Arsenal, the return
Merciless
You emcees got alot to worry about
Y'all salute

Yo, it's the raw ferocious
The body hard-metal soloist
A poisionous comb with a strike to the throat to kill opponents
It's still hopeless, I'm still arming verbal explosives
I'm still the coldest, I'm still the sickest, the diagnosis
I promised y'all before Moses
The promise I gave emcees 
still ain't no different from what a bible oath is
A promise with a right hand, y'all fools can testify
Define the illest emcee, the machine can detect a lies
I specialize in street rhymes and telling war tales
The forecast when I brainstorm raps is all hell
I dare somebody to brag, I'll leave them hostage gagged
The modest'll stab fast as a hand through a speed bag
'Cause I'm a battle cat, like in Iraq with a battle rap
Comin' out of a red flat with a gat and anthrax
I'm like 212 degrees celsius hotter
Beef or more live, the shiverless is getting slottered
Give me 5 mics

[Chorus (scratching)]
recognize...the illest...emcee...no doubt...coming through with the roughness
recognize...the illest...emcee...better beleive that

They say me and mics are like Jesus Christ and a bible scrolls
And me and mics is like Faith and Joe when they hatin' foes
My name exposed in 96 in a demo battles
After the Rap Essentials, the critics became the battle
I wrote the first of military verse in double barrels
The first to spit Kadafi, and the first to use the nazis
The first to talk about desciples and the Vietnamese
Or hang draft in trees and invade with M-16's
Sharper than guillotines to switch blades my spit plauges
Invades like Y2K's and sprays with verbal bullets
Including gernades, with no pins, my tounge pulled it
Bleed in fatigues, my flow's mud and sea weed
You eatin' me is like David in a fight with Golaith
Me eatin you is like the stones in the sling before he fired 'em
Still the nicest, take any mic alive and leave it lifeless
You soon read about me in the Unsigned Hype shit
Give me 5 mics

[Chorus]

It's through the birth of skills, reincarnated, born again
Cutting the imbellicale cord, the ill emcee's born with a pen
You fucked your article, rappers done wanna criticise
I'm different than Nas, the only thing be saying we both wise
But otherwise I'm raw, the lord of metaphores
Strong as a pitbull's jaws, can chill with 48 bars
The hardest soloist, never speaks with hard poses
It's animated with fake hugs in the showbiz
I'm being hated and underrated, but still I made it
Got sick of this shit till everything I spit's contaminated
You know the albums of emcees that barely spit themselves
Pay enough ill emcees just to make they shit sell
I spit napom, tick-ass raps evacuate
I'm a 4 second left time bomb, rap detonate
So fuck y'all if signing me's not negoitable
Just one of my metaphores deserve the hip-hop quotable
Give me five mics

Intro:

Yeah, Step X Step up in here
Yeah, this is Funky Dredds up on the mic
Comin at you one time cos I'm out to git mines, yeah

Oh yes, I'm out to git mi-ines, I thought you knew
I'm kickin it wit the platinum click, Buckdown is my record crew
I'm comin correct wit my intellects, I do what I gotta do
And on the microphone I'm still flexin
and checkin, all the suckers in my path
I'm flippin and rippin the script, WADOH! and givin you whiplash
I'm like the Energizer rabbit, I just keep goin and goin
And when I'm rockin a microphone I just keep flowin and flowin
I'm lettin you know, I don't be wastin my time
I'm makin the greens, by any means, cos I'm out to git mines
I gotta get this, gotta get that, gotta keep cashin in my dividends
Gotta be havin a gang of ends when I'm chillin wit my friends
(Can you spare a dime?) Nigga, I need you to get a job though
(But I don't have the time) Then I ain't emptyin out my chip, bro
I don't be makin them rules about you bein in the shoes you're in
I'm sure that Mcky D's and Burger King is probably hirin
Nevertheless, I'm keepin a count of every chip
I'm out to get what I can get, cos what I want be costin a grip
Yeah, when I be steppin and wreckin a mic on the stage
I got my people on my mind, I'm out to git mines, fool

Chorus: (x3)

Indo, be sure, you got to get what's yours
(I'm out to git mines, I'm out to git mines)
Indo, you know you got to get what's yours
(I'm out to git mines)

Oh yes, I be enquirin to those that be inspirin me
So I can obtain some results in the industry
Thankyou much, as I be earnin my own wealth
Till Omega Day, I will be compensatin myself
See only my ????? increase slowly but surely, you see
I got the ends cos I's be HOT on the M-I-C
It's some of them chicks that I clock from all of my success
A donation to my peoples cos of them, I'm blessed
I, remember back in the day, when I used to be poor
Now I got chips galore and you besta believe I'm out to git more
and then some, I ain't missin out on none
That's why I became an entrepenuer, on the mic, now I got a gang of ones
(Can I get a loan?) Man, you're trippin, where your peoples at?
(But I don't have a home) Here, you better not get no crack
Outta my way, I must commence to get my pay
I got just one thing on my mind, I'm out to git mines

Chorus (x2)

I'm out to git mines, how many times must I repeat it?
If you're not down wit my click, then I might just tell you to beat it
like Michael, Jackson, it's time for some action
I already made up my mind that I'm out to git mines
In the 9-5, my crew be rollin thick, I wanted to make my ends quick
So I'm out doin licks
on whoever, I never take a chance of bein broke
So don't test me, cos you know I ain't no joke
And I hope, you remember the point I'm tryin to get across
I'm out to git mines so I gotta be my own boss
At the crossroads of life, what should I do?
I gotta get mines, I thought you knew
(Here's a telegram) I wonder who that could be from?
(I think it's Uncle Sam) I thought I reported all my income
Oh well, no means, I'll just break em off a chip of my chunk
It's all good cos I still gotta make a hump

Chorus:

I do what I wanna do, when I want to
(I'm out to git mines, I'm out to git mines)
(I'm out to git mines)
(I'm out to git mines, I'm out to git mines)
(I'm out to git mines)

Shh, shh, shh shh
Gra-grammar like a sledgehammer
Shh, shh, shh, shh
Gra-grammar like a sledgehammer
Shh, shh, shh, shh
Stackin' pennies like Hardaway
It's hard to play with the M. Child
Ha ha

[Verse 1]
It be some evil that these men do
I spit game so cold, playas froze coming to my kin do
Gangsta hats and trench coats, I pimp notes with quotes
Like playa haters takin' guns to they throats
Oh no, I'm walking down the strip, poppin' clips
I see O.J., sliced her from her clit to her vertebrae
Murder mayday, it's a third degree slaughter
I aint trying to be broke, I need diapers for my daughter
Further up the strip it's some sisters prostituting, dealers looting
Grabbed my bulletproof too and started shooting
No half steps, I blast techs, homie you can ask Rex
Get twisted with mister, I'll leave dripping like a tampex
Tampon, strap on, the whole, entire
Shooting cocaine through my veins and now it feels like I'm on fire
But still I wanna get higher
Double crosses get double crossed, lost, get caught up in the crossfire
Still down to serve a fiend, partner you done heard of me
Cock this 4-4 and make the snitch come out of Hercules
Hurting these bustas with my murder threats
The murder reps, swirving a 9 fif candied out converted Lex
And you don't wanna flex with me, you better off on LSD
Well let's see, who's joking around like Bill Bellamy

[Verse 2]
Speak of the uniqueness, freakiness like Jodeci
Mister murder poetry, mack is on the low key
Slow moving, grooving like a sidewinder
Ripping fools for thinking y'all's a liva rhymer (Tricks)
I signed a contract in blood, took a playas oath
Now I'm smoking blunts, making toasts coast to coast
I know for ways of acting stank and stuck up
I'm back like Tyson so you better get your guns up.
I'm in the 7-5-0 riding t-genuine
Me and Mike drunk off tequila and gin
Spin the bottle, hit the throttle, y'all can't stop us
Fools will drop like shocks when the shots bust
Must make stacks, made a batch of bomb hits
With my click, no the whole nation's on it

[Verse 3]
B-b-b-bomb the glock, it's hot rocks on your block
From Pittsburgh to Texas they compose it like Frank Sinat-tra
I see you brah it's murder on your mind
I downs the Crown and now it's murder with my nine
I am superior, inferior higher than Cooley
Done choked and smoked get done up like some doobies
Who me, the playa from the SC
Busta, no doubt we pout, I wear you out like some Guess jeans
Redeem yourself from all of this madness
Back up in your uh is that playa wearing glasses

[Verse 4]
Calling the troops like Saudi, it's an all out attack
I'm strapped with black gats, and rough raps, to break your back, jack
Cataracts is what they call me cause I can't be seen
Mean is dope ya know, as I fiend for the green (For the green)
Guillotine, sharp on point like a bullseye
Cause nothing is short of super in my mental hoo-ride
Who's died, yeah y'all know that I went for none
Them said bring the drama so I had to bring them some
From the crib Suave House, same address
Contest or confess when it hits you in the chest
Rest assured that it's pure when I kick it
Best mature and handle your business
Tricks, so now I got bustas in handcuffs
On a manhunt, I'm staying tough, rolling up the next blunt
Y'all cannot see me on your tip-toes
I got killers that will kill from Mr. Mike where the wind blows
Benzos get burnt Lexs and Verts get took
Now who's the crook, I'm superfly like Jimmy Snook
My crew will jump on you like crickets
Handle they business, and now I must come wicked
Tape you, the young Steven Speilberg
They wanna mob with me, cause I be smoking real herb
That doja pushing more crystals than Folger's
Hold ya breath it's going down trick I told ya

Shh, shh, shh shh
Gra-grammar like a sledgehammer
Shh, shh, shh, shh
Gra-grammar like a sledgehammer
Shh, shh, shh, shh
Stackin' pennies like Hardaway

(Cut Father)[Talking]
Yeah, from the top..I dont think they know
But as if you didnt know by now
Ill Brothers, Swollen Members, (Buc Fifty),T2B Fam
It never stop...Too many ducks in the game now
Its about...time we evaporate all you muh'fuckers for real
No doubt, We live to spit the real (yeah) We live to spit the real (uh)

(Cut Father)
Line fanatic
Attack rhymes leave damaging foes
Who appose Cut Father
Couldnt manage to erase me out the game
Southeast 6-1-9 battle veteran
Into competition I
Victimize verb spray, ghetto wordplay
Take shit back to the days of K-day
Ready rock, Babylonga chest non-stop
World domination fuck curves serve ya' block
South Pacific, Scientific cause panic
Spittin' lines to rep for the flaw see eyed planet
Ya homosexual rap cats can scratch that
Gun play for gays fake thugs fake ways
Thoughts are generated never scared to start spittin'
Dont hear nothing but the music im slippin'
Ill Brothers..ever evolving ducks fallin'
Into rhyme relapse these rugged tracks
Mad Child (blaze) spittin real pine chalk
In memory of Rob One cuz he cant be stopped

(Chorus)[Scratched]

(Mad Child)
Swingin' the axe
Bringin the pain while I'm bringing the facts
Keep climbing cuz I'm working while these others relax
Rippin' tracks with Cut Father no bother half steppin'
Mad Child and Buc Fifty thats 3 deadly weapons
Reppin' the West
Staple a Maple Leaf to my chest
Thats 16 bars between stars and stripes
Used to go to malls and fight
Now I stay up all night
Thinking...mapping out my future cuz my families tight
We keep it thorough
I get inside ya head just like a neuro-surgeon
There's some my origin it's discouragin
No fadin' this Canadian Hurricane
Keep flourishin' doubt this how's this?
I put my money where my mouth is
Jobs for North and South
You dont know nothing about this
Partners starting to label
Label the rock for the unstable
Terrifying talents
Of the mentally unbalanced
King of skull-crushing confusion
That welcomes any challenge

(Chorus)

(Buc Fifty)
I can handcuff lightning throw thunder in jail
Hold tornadoes in the palm of both hands without bail
For fade-away diggin bomb...I am phenomo-nail
If I layed on train tracks I'd make that shit da-rail
Hold still I'm so ill I make medicine sick
Killa bricks so my head split while I'm playing with this
Stylin' till I'm ill I'm good and well done with it
You a broke wrist rapper with a full flavor pack of
Jimmy on the breath sugar footed crew dat back ya'
Gimme a reason to step up to ya fools and jack-jackas
Backpackas out-ac-actors that can stacksa casual factors
While I keep ya whack whackers

[Rockie Fresh]
I be that young nigga from Chicago
'Bout to heat the city up and make it feel like Cabo, yeah
Watch these niggas try and take my shine
I told these foolies, hard work and it'll come in time
For now just watch me tell my vision on your television
On MTV and 106 in some of the freshest fits
But I ain't focused on these clothes, I got some goals to hit
Finished the album then I'm working on a movie script
Kenny I got you, and these niggas say they knots is thick
My Goyard got one card that'll take your bitch
No stacks needed, undefeated we ain't losing shit
Bitch, I got options so I'm copping if I choosing it

[Chorus: Rockie Fresh]
Yeah, oh man, look at me
I'm becoming everything I wish I be
I got bitches, I got cake
Wake up everyday and I say, "God is great!"
God is great, God is great
You see the watch, you see the chain, you know that God is great
God is great, God is great
Even when these niggas hate, God is great

[Rockie Fresh]
And as a youngin' I just knew that I was gon' provide
In the G-wagon swagging when I wanna ride
In neighborhoods where I ain't worried 'bout no homicide
Me and my niggas won't fall victim to no kind of pride
Know when to stay humble, niggas thought I was sign and dive
I just started working on tours four and five
Now watch me travel, never tattle, snitches slowly die
You heard it before, but, real niggas only multiply
Strengthen my numbers, friend or foe, the flow ain't got a flaw; Eddie Murphy, I am raw
Vince McMahon, I am raw, I cop it, still it's fuck the law
Don't be phony, homie; don't be filthy, nigga
Be great, don't hate, get wealthy, nigga

Now live your life to the fullest, at least you try for it

[all samples]
Tom..	check it out..
	I gotta talk natural..
Expansion..
	Go in front of the industry bullshitters..
Devotion..
	I gotta tell it like it is, my way now!
I wanna say somethin tonight that might.. wherever you are..
if you're in radio land or if you're right here..

[Maroons]
Ooooh, it existed in you
It exist in love too
Respect your golden rule

Your soul is the only proof
It existed in you
Respect your golden rule

[Lateef]
I ain't gon' wear no clown bells, not pass my crown
They didn't tell you bout my golden rule?  Write this on down
Almight love is eternal, what go around come around
From the chatter of Africa to the talk of the town
It be the pattern makes the matter was beyond the profound
They're strategizin the sound since the beginnin of time
And everything is divine, so tell me why you on mine?
I promise closer that you get to the throne, the less it shine
It takes, responsibility, a keen mind and spine
Rhythm up in the rhyme, livin in the design
and inclined to, give a little take a little re-organize it
Have the aftermath covered ??
Even if you don't just gotta keep try-in
Ain't no need to wonder see, people gon', always try and
steal your thunder better bring your um-brella
Cause it's gon' be rain, to fella, let me tell ya one thing
Somethin new, could happen, it do everday, it's
how you ride the wave with implicit simplici-ty
and move around them obstacles with, liquid fluidi-ty
and be, just a moment til you write your own page
It's always somebody tryin to get paid off what you made
Lamp in the shade while I slave but like Kam say, +Neva Again+
My windpipe, is like a loaded twelve gauge
and I'ma leave up in a blaze of glory glory, that's if
they want the funk but that's still yet another story
Not all of this wack junk, that we done been ENDURIN
And no practice shows from crumbs they're straight BORIN
You get laughed at, with that crap, while we're TOURIN
from coast to coast, border to border shore to shore
reaction from the hardcore
and I'ma go on and on and on and..
Shock rock it to the early Shirley Murdoch morning
Killing the yawning when I'm up on it to the break of down
Shakin down, breakin down, my opponents
into they various components, like I'm engineerin the show
The vigilante microphone is, BLAZED off the chronic
Anti-demonic harmonic phonics
You best respect on G.P., like the Sonics
Flows be hypnotic, got your head noddin
Off the bionic, make you feel like you retarded
The party it ain't started til the Lateef, Maroons, Quannum
the whole damn spot it get hot
and I ain't gon' wear no clown bells nah pass my crown
They didn't tell you bout my golden rule, write this on down
I ain't gon' play the minstrel fool, not pass my crown
They didn't tell you bout my golden rule, write this on down
I ain't gon' do it -- pass my crown
They didn't tell you bout my golden rule, write this on down
Almighty love is eternal what go around come around
From the chatter of Africa to the talk of the town
From the chatter of Africa to the talk of the town
From the chatter of Africa to the talk of the town
From the chatter of Africa .. so check it out now..

[Maroons] * overlaps last four lines *
Ooooh, it existed in you
It exist in love too
Respect your golden rule

Oooh, it exists in the truth
It existed in you
Respect your golden rule

Ooooh, you can't learn it in school
Your soul is the only too
Respect your golden rule

Oooh, you here now to find your own groove
We're here to set you free from your blues
You're now in tune with Maroons..

Verse 1: (Noreaga)

I blow shots at these faggots, these niggas is herbs
my vertical switch, converted with nerve 
catch my anywhere, gun down, hand on my dick
these hoes love me, these niggas just salute the God
I boosted cars, now I just cop and spend loot at bars 
I got little paper, these cats still hatin' 
but now I send shots racin', shots like Gary Payton 
I'm Jose, I'm half God and half Satan 
I fuck with Lake, dump bodies in the lake 
ain't no tellin' what othet measurements we take
I brought my niggas out the hood yo, not just me
and now Maze live in Jers' and Mussolini 
and I'm a nigga that flip shit and just hawk spit
these niggas had beef but now they wanna squash it 
I'm a thug and hustler, not a pimp or a mack 
it's N.O.R.E., you know, the Limp Bizkit of rap. 

Chorus (Noreaga)

Yo Lake, what the fuck man?
cock the calicko, make these niggas duck man

and we ain't wit' talkin', we gon' buck man 
(repeat)

Verse 2: (Lake)

It's like the game is over, soldiers don't listen 
bitches ain't loyal and generals is snitchin' 
my breed is becoming extinct, we all dyin'
layin' in the mattress or on the run hidin' 
livest niggas is comin' home gettin' jobs 
it hurts my heart to see a real niggas starve 
carved a niggas face so bad in a rumble 
they had me in the bing in the fall wearin' a muzzle 
bubble for my niggas in prison wearin' mittens
when you get the privelege of freedom start livin'
I spit it with integrity, still keep it thorough'n 
move heroin every town and borough I'm in 
a candy store with Christian Diore 
on Iceburg Valore with suede beiges on 
I morn on the born of my dog thats in the essence
express and live on, I incorporate the jail letters
my life is epic, accept it, I'm what you wanna be
before I let 'em cuff me white sheets 'll cover me
why? 'cause I'm a serious nigga with a serious mind 
so if I get locked up I'll be serious time. 

Chorus 

Hey yo 'pone, what the fuck man
grab the Calicko, make these niggas duck man
they outta luck man 
and we ain't wit' talkin', we gon' buck man 
(repeat)

Verse 3: (Capone)

Peep the gangsta physiche, slim, fire with a fetish 
move with a deathwish, bullets turn brolic niggas anorexic 
life's hectic, push weight and records 
still spazzin', take your necklace, I stay connected
spit any niggas block on lean 
tinted glass, three inches cracked down, Mac in between 
cut school, got paid slingin' crack to the dean 
seen a heemy head blow turn back to a fiend 
Capone, Luciano, and Mega, Noreaga 
here to drop anonymous tips, bitches flip for the right paper 
it's pain, time, and glory, the essence of the thoroughest nigga, I rest
my faith in the corner 
watch me get up on ya

(repeat)

Verse 4: (Mega)

My life is blood money and big guns
I'm the nigga your connect get hit from 
hello, and I rep the ghetto, how real is that?
nigga you too cocky 
I'm like Tupac, who could stop me?
I got a message from Papi
who the body in the trunk? I wanna know like Joe
my flow ill like 'pone's Tahoe
fuck the fake shit
son, look at us, we all did state bids 
I'm in it to win but I lost my patience 
niggas def, dumb, and blind when I floss my bracelet
in Queensbridge, in the scene with Benzes and Beamers 
niggas who hate cops and love squeezin' 
whats the meanin'? all hail the thug allegiance
tryin' to get right 'cause I don't want my unborn seeds slingin'
the Mantana shit, banana clips 
bringin' to niggas if my Man is hit.

Song:   It's Good To Be the Queen
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

* organized by Rhino comp. for convenience regardless of original

Ahh, ooh, ahh, ohh, ahh, ohh, ahh, ohh
I'm Sylvia, that's the name
Rappin Queen's my claim to fame
Gonna tell you a story you didn't know
Get ready get set, cause here I go
I knew the land, of Rappersville
Castle on a mount called Sugar Hill
Like Diana Ross said loud and clear:
"This is my house, I live here!"
We have a King, I must confess --
we share everything cause we love the best
We have money and friends of every kind
Friends are his, money's mine
My every wish, is his command
Furs everyday at the wave of my hand
I consider myself a fortunate lady
sporting my Rolls, and grey Mercedes
Ahhhh, ha ha ha!	*singers come in*

		[Chorus]
	Ohh yes it's good to be the Queen, ohh la la
	Gee but it's good to be the Queen
(sing it girls/what it is, is what is is/sing it girls/sing it girls/well)
	You can be sure about one thing, ohh la la
	Ma oui/Ohh yes!/ma oui/Ohh yes!/ma oui  It's good to be the Queen

The Queen of Sugar Hill, ahhh...
We partied all day in the castle all night
All the VIP's of the world was in sight
Drinks were free so was the fun
There was more than enough for everyone
So Sammy and Frankie, mingle in the crowd
Heard Stevie and Michael, singin out loud
They were hippin and hoppin all over the place
Bangin the boogie right in my face
I got on the mic and I started to rap
Feet start slappin, hands began to clap
They were cuttin up records, faster and faster
But no one did it like our Grandmaster
The fun I had, I could not measure
This rappin, is a sho nuff treasure
The people all stood and began to scream
As somebody yelled, "Long... live the Queen"

		[Chorus]

It's good to be the Queen!
	Badi mbatu badi mbatu badi mbatu badi mbat
        Badi mbatu BADI MBATU badi mbatu badi mbatu

It started back, in seventy-nine
My whole darn future, was on the line
I created, a brand, new sensation
Through my mind and the whole darn nation
With the Big Bank Hank, the Wonder Mike
And this kid called Master G (that's me)
Well would you believe their Rapper's Delight
went down in history, hahaha!

		[Chorus]
 
I'll never forget, the King of Kings...
Break it on down
Funk...

	Badi mbatu badi mbatu badi mbatu badi mbat
	Badi mbatu BADI MBATU badi mbatu badi mbatu

Mmm... Sugar Hill, funk
Your fantasy, is my reality

		[Chorus]
		[Chorus]

It's good, so good, good, mmmmm
It's good, so good, good, hahahaha, mmmmm
I like it

[Hook - 2x]
Mami I got something for your mouth
You can heat me on the bed, even on the couch
And it ain't no telling, when the night gon end
Might be the Telly, or the back of the Benz

[Noke D]
I love some mean grain, tongue ring games
Baby, you can gobble me while I'm switching lanes
My niggaz with me, and they all powered up
Stop tripping off the kitty cat, just swallow up
Got lost in the ass suga, you ain't gotta stare
You can hop on in the Benz, see the back of your hair

[D-Gotti]
I'm like ooh yeah, baby no
Why we can't wait, till we get to the Mo'
Ain't trying to crash the chrome, while you getting your face mask on
Trunk knocking, you can't hear me moan
I love dome-dome-dome-dome, dome I do a thug
When you get off work baby, slide by the spot
And let a playa, get a lil' bit more
I swore, I wouldn't tell nobody
How your tongue wiggle, round the rolls of D-Gotti
And you probably giving me, the brains I didn't never had
Put me to sleep behind the wheel of a Jag, now you know that's bad
We at our pad baby got a Ph.D., and plus she a undergrad
I wanna ask her, to do me everyday
But I told her just call, whenever we could play, you feel me

[Hook - 2x]

[Noke D]
Why do you do me like that, sugar brown
When I'm on the E, I love having you around
Call me crazy, but I'm coocoo for the brains
Baby girl I apologize, for the time I skid on your braids
I stop by your job, and take you out to brunch
And girl I got a hunch, that we gon be here for some months

[D-Gotti]
Mama it's lunch time, how was your morning
Who me, baby I'm fine
And I was just wondering, could you come to the ride
And calm my bad nerves, help me cum one time
One time, I really been missing the tongue kissing
You do like my piece, you platinum with it
I admitted to myself, you the Jaws of the South
Girl a diva I meant, that do wonders with her mouth
Ouch, suga watch them teeth
Now I know why all your pants, got holes in the knees
Slowly, you rock that mic
Keep doing your thug thang, just don't bite

[Hook - 2x]

[Noke D]
Well uh it's alright suga, you know what you mean to me
You might not know it cause I don't show it, it ain't what it seem to be
Uh-huh na-uh, it's been a time girl would you like to feed's
Just remember what the old folks say, girl you are what you eat
My queenie my genie, no T.V. on the way
Me and G-O-T-T-I, can do this everyday

[D-Gotti]
You spent all day long, talking on the phone
Mami stop admitting, put your mouth up on the bone
I stop by your home, with no invitation
I ain't even call, to make reservations
Sensational, I love the sensation
Of gum lips, in my preservation
Uh, you got me so ain't done
So who am I to, you ain't my girl
Baby the brains is free, the gas cost
Cash all I need to mash, I proceed to smash
Off, and run a route like Moss
But chill baby, I'll be back on my job, I'm gone

Song:   Gotta Love Gangsta's
Typed by: TwstdFlava@aol.com

Ha ha ha, mutha-fuckin' westside niggas
Gotta love gangsta's
(You got to love a gangsta)
You gotta love gangsta's
Tha Realest
Richie Rich
And mutha-fuckin' Scarface
Gotta love gangsta's
Why? How we ride
(You got to love a gangsta)

Who can we tell about our conversations?
Nobody, cuz these niggas always playa hatin'
Cuz we gangsta's
Every corner that we off 'n turn
So many niggas lost their lives, so our hearts were burned
Eternally, we talkin' cold to get our points across
Everybody know The Don is the fuckin' boss
Ain't no top secrets in the desk or hidin' dead bodies
Keep your mouth closed and never ever tell nobody
Or you'll be murdered
Get an alias, that's a smart move
So many snitches around, sometimes we often lose
From niggas bullshittin'
Breakin' down under pressure
I have no choice but to take some fuckin' drastic measures
Through-out the world, smugglin' drugs through the 50 states
And overseas, we ??? to communicate
Stay up on game nigga
Tattle-tale don't last long
Just remember these rules and then you'll stand strong
We never communicate with strangers
It's the last sucka
So you gotta love gangsta's

1 -     Gotta love gangsta's cuz gangsta's do thug shit
        I said you gotta love gangsta's cuz we don't take no bullshit
        You gotta love gangsta's because we mash for dreams
        You gotta love gangsta's because we ride on our enemies

Richie Rich! Ha ha ha 
Tha Realest
You know you love gangsta's
You like the way they do things
You understand me?
(Check this out)

Nigga tweek on it
But before you speak on it
Don't talk on it if you can't walk on it
It's deep, ain't it?
Picasso can't paint it
I'm tough wit it 
These niggas pass, puff wit it
Choke on it
Since Tha Realest spoke on it
I'll die wit it
Mutha-fucka get high wit it
I did it
He did it
'Face do it
Be true to it
Many niggas new to it
It hurt, don't it?
Nutty square niggas want it
But can't feel it
Ha ha, it take a gangsta to get it

Repeat 1

Tattoos cover my whole body
Alias name on the streets, they call him John Gotti
For puttin' in work nigga
Soldiers sometimes die daily
Don't shed no tears, cuz in my mind, only God can save me
No bullshit
Penitentaries can't hold my pain
They often set a nigga up for their own selfish game
And that's no lie
Open your eyes and peep this shit clearly
So many gangsta's have died, and they're missed dearly
And that's for real homie
Pick 'em out and tell me who
I got the last sucka, that'll love to go and do 'em
Twelve'll blast a nigga
Nobody knows his name
They only know his face
This is the introduction
To Mista Scarface

Gangsta love, shermy, Super Sport on dubs
Mobbin' deep in the club for the homies and thugs
Niggas who ride for they shit, die for they shit
Smokin' fry up in this bitch
Down to fire on this snitch
What the fuck are they yellin'? (Gangsta)
In love wit how we do that, pullin' away
Totin' 2 straps, now who dat?
Thinkin' they bad enough to run up on niggas who ain't givin' a fuck
Nigga you want some?

Repeat 1

Ha ha ha
Mutha-fuckin' gangsta's (westside)
Richie Rich
Mutha-fuckin' Scarface ride on them mutha-fuckin' ?rits?
3 of the realest gangsta's you mutha-fuckas ever heard
Locked down shit from the east, west, and the mutha-fuckin' south 
(The west, south, and the mutha-fuckin' east niggas)
Thug shit, thug shit
Gotta love gangsta's (gotta love us)
Bitch niggas run from us/Mutha-fuckin' gangsta shit

[Intro: Rockie Fresh]
Rockie Fresh and I'm from Chicago
Where young niggas die every few seconds
But we still just wanna be great Americans, yeah

[Rick Ross]
Uh, I was born to be another number
So was number 1, I pray I never fumble
Uh, I used to wear the cheapest clothes
Now my posters in the reefer stores
I be posted like I’m 7’4
Till the day I'm knocking at my Heaven's door
Just like Club LIV when that confetti fall
I fell in love with the game, damn it's a distant love
I let her see it just to tell her friends what she saw
200 mill how I get it, damn I can't be far
I keep my sneakers low cut
Heat fitted, G-5 with the nose up
Self made St. Regis with the toast up
Roomservice, Belaire time to toast up
My attraction have African in them happy homes
Never seen a square nigga with a happy home
All the money generated, double M the greatest
Rest in peace to every genius that never made it
Don't it sound like I'm dedicated
Joe Flacco deal, nigga with hot flows
Whole cheerleading squad all through my iPhone
All them hoes in my iPhone, nigga - yeah
Sneakers snow white, nigga, at the 50 yard line
HUH!

[Interlude: Kay Foxx]
"It's Kay Foxx reporting live. A Carol City rapper
facing the music connected to an alleged robbery and assault.
Gunplay surrendered at Miami-Dade headquarter -
the charge armed robbery means he cannot post bond."

[Gunplay]
Momma po', Daddy po', what's the antidote?
Wind through the window blew the candle out
No lights, many cold nights
Hungry belly burning yearning rice
Rent late, on a plate just a blank space
Old girl lookin' at me with the blank face
Made it off a prayer and a saint's grace
AK's kept me in a safe space
Sucka free for the one three
Probably on tour for the one four
Sucka tried to give me life plus one more
But I gave it back and told them "fuck y'all!"
In this day and time I got a .89
Miami state of mind: cocaine, steak and wine
Understand I over came
Made it through rain and open flames

[Interlude: Rick Ross]
Niggas was over, practically nothin'
Who became great Americans...

[Fabolous]
Uh, my car be parked out front of Darby (yeah)
My chick Barbie, your bitch Gar-B
A-G-E, I just A-T-E
Sippin' A-C-E over at A-B-E (nice)
And offers; I'm not a back and further
I don't make friends, baby I make offers
Like you can get with this (or), or you can get with that (huh)
I think you get with this (huh), cause this is where it's at (haha)
Hate when broke niggas try to play mediator (word)
Keep your two cents to yourself, you might need it later (word)
Silence is golden, then duck tape is silver (yeah)
Professional shooters Leon and Mathilda
Yeah, my woman vary just give me a young Tahiry (feel me?)
Who do whatever I ask of her, dead Siri (feel me?)
My theory keep winning as the days change
Yesterday's home-runs won't win today's games, nigga
Win today's games, nigga.. uh

[Outro: Rockie Fresh]
Life's a game, it's only how you play it
Take advice from a few who made it
Got a chance, you should go and take it
Get it now, homie, why you waitin'?
Got a dream, you should go and chase it
Be creative, stop bein' basic
Keep it movin', don't become placed
Show love, why you hatin'?
You could be somebody famous {*2X*}
Go get it man, dreams, yeah

Song:   Greed	
Typed by: Nelson2014@aol.com

Verse 1:
One two now 
It's A+ and the Hieroglyphics is the crew now 
Presently showing you how to make a tune sound
Make the roof pound if you play the levels too loud
Impossible to cool down
Make the ladies say "ooh oow"
Brothers yellin' (hoe) 
I still be rockin' the party even though the other one is sellin'
Mr. A+ never was a felon
And I could be lyin' but no one is tellin'
I come from heaven and it's nice to meet you 
People be trippin' hella faulty is how they like to treat you
You could think I'm slippin' and you saucy but then I defeat you
Faulty images I can see through
You should try to be you instead of that nigga you tryin' to be dude
I could expose every copy carbon (yeah) 
But I'm makin' sure life never got me starvin'
I'm move makin' cause the tomb is waitin' 
And if you truly through with fakin' you'll awaken
Or you can remain another through the breakin'

Hook:
There's more to life than what they're all hollerin'
But if you remain tolerant 
And when you're dead look where your dollar went
It should all be common sense 
But look at what the single word greed got us in

Verse 2:
So bad you think you've got to see your views darkenin'
And then you caught again 
Now you see there's no defense against the consequences (so)
It's all plain and simple (what?)
Refrain from simpin' about some shit you claim you been through
I'm takin' the good with the bad things 
I can remember when all I wanted was to have things 
But now it's not what I can give but what I can bring
To the sad scene 
Fat stacks, green for the rap fiends
With no actin' 
No unbelievable tale 
That you can see that is stale
All the pretendin' is seemin' to fail
I won't laugh when you are leavin' to jail
Cause the way this country is it could be me in the cell
Steady fiendin' for mail
But that's highly unlikely
I'm shinin'  with a light so brightly 
Blindin' your sight 
We keep you rewindin' nightly
Remindin' you politely 
Of hip hop formed tightly

Hook

Outro:
Hieroglyphics in the house y'all. For y'all greedy bastards out there.

Typed by: no1wammy@hotmail.com 

[Obie Trice]
(Verse 1)
You got money
For you to come out, it's best
I pack a gat the size of a rat in south west
When I get low
I get dough
So it's nothin' for you to pass me and get broke
I been like this
Since the lickle youth
Stickin' cats for better major Skittles, too
Now Or Later's, Jolly Rangers and Charlie Juice
What can I say, dog, I had the sweetest tooth
In middle school, ain't shit changed but the vics
Sock a nigga in his lips and take his kicks
Shit
Ain't this a bitch, they don't fit
Fuck it
I sell 'em quick, to get the chips
At high school
Things got hella proper
I stop hittin' cats and start hittin' their lockers
I got purses and wallets for my big pockets
Bitch, shut the fuck up and give me the watches

[Chorus: Obie Trice]
When that nigga get hungry
You, gimme the money
Bitch, gimme the money
You, gimme the money
When I can't get high
You, gimme the money
Bitch, gimme the money
You, gimme the money
When I can't pay the rent
Bitch, gimme the money
You, gimme the money
Bitch, gimme the money
When the shit's gettin' thick
You, gimme the money
Bitch, gimme the money (Nigga)
You, gimme the money (Bitch)

(Verse 2)
When I'm starvin' and the dough get low
And my daughter
Kobe gotta eat, I be more go in the street
Lookin' for victims, strapped with their heat
You wet the payphone
Your scrap's gone
With me
Tried to run
Popped in the knee
I'm popular for poppin' up on niggas when my pocket's on
E, pistol point
Person and a purse
"Just don't kill me, I got two children"
I can't front
I might snatch the shit
That you probably don't want
Run at two
My daughter Kobe, she two
And I ain't got a job
So why would you ask me when I'm robbing you, fuck you
By all means nec'sy
Get outta line while I'm stickin'
The shit right there get's messy
Caliber heavy
Ready to bust, nigga
Run 'em jewels, or your dick's in the dust (Motherfucker)

[Chorus]

(Verse 3)
I'm a starvin' artist, my cho, do-do
I stick gats for chains like them cats, they guru
Bitch, gimme the money, pullin' their gat from the back
We gaffle and cap, won't be raffled to strap
We travel in packs, might see us comin' the day
You better tuck in your chain when you see us coming your way
My pockets are hurtin'
Plus I'm tired of workin'
But nowadays, a J-O-B just ain't workin'
You trade blocks to get hot
Cause if you got
Dog, gimme the glock, you just got got
I drink too much and the weed be talkin'
Dog get jacked by a cat from New Boston
My habit is costin'
Twenty dollars a fix
I own
So what you have gone get me out of this shit
From tents to cables
To gems
I'm Hardcore
Detriot nigga that'll stick Lil' Kim

Song:   Get Rich or Try Dying
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Despot]
The "told ya so" kid, lookin like he's itchin to sing
The day hell got cold, sellin plane tickets to pigs
Time-tested method for turnin a fat chance slim
No win dyin, push whatever's bad back in
And that grin's there is through first, place taste beautiful
A cookie for the straightest faces, spilled milk's funeral
Snoopin through the junk for a tall glass to tip it in
Shootin at his feet only tryin to see what he steppin in
So far just the street, at least makin use of the weapon hand
No promise to keep a set force in the mode of guess again
Food stuck in the bristles, every brush with death tickles
'Round the mouth the whistle creation of birth in the middle
When the pistol swivel towards the sunny spot he chose to sit in
Holding hands up, flashin a joy buzzer, just kiddin
Then a spark and a single shot that start the face sinkin
Caught the bullseye blinkin, thought of that usin thinkin

[Chorus]
Get rich or try dyin, life for the buyin
Out went the beatin hearts and in went the diamonds
Brown when the bleeding starts and green cause it's shinin
Here's to the late great man who left smilin
What a guy - he never died while he was alive
Slap him five - he never died while he was alive
Say goodbye - he never died while he was alive
Six million ways, never gave one a try

"Dig for the golllld, dig for the gollld
Diiiig, for the gold
I'll be a rich man in China, b-b-b-before I grow old"

[Despot]
Here lies the hair that he split from temptations
And the gun still blazin, how's that for patience?
Hammer clappin off, another story for the ages
Snuff dug up snug in the backs of the turned pages
like, "Move or the chapter that you're standin in gets it~!"
For the record he only did it to teach a lesson
So hang your hat on the bullet sleepin take it as a blessin
That chalk outline is stretchin big so everyone can get in
Listen for the best and discover the fastest way to quiet
Tune in to that terrible screamin they call silent
'Til heaven's tremblin hand is there to scratch open your eyes
This nickel pitched between the fingers find today's lottery prizes
Scrapin up shotty is how you fight it's for the feedin frenzy
Tripped over a treasure chest while in hot pursuit of a penny
The shy {*edit*} shoppin cart chock full of that new alchemy
Tin cans to paper and he dragged it off happily

[Chorus]

[Despot]
Caught a shiny glint and thought he finally hit luck
Then a snake in the garden jumped out that can of mixed nuts
Snap it shut quick enough and show it how to lick {cunt}
Short end of the stick taped to somethin big, still tough
One man's garbage is another man's big bluff
Dog got a new hold, opportunity's been stuck
And he's blue from the wrist up, huntin that stubborn payload
Holdin breaths for Jack, caught on the wrong end of the rainbow
Thumb in the goldrush with the ring flipped so the name shows
Other four fingers crossed hard enough to break bones
Sharp enough to stay gold, claim a chunk for free
Now it's hundreds of the same stone worth its weight in debris
But at least he gets to say he chipped away and got a piece
Before he figured out there's ones about, there's nothin here to see
But I still poke it, every X next to a tree
So you probably know the words a little better than me

[repeat to fade]
"Dig for the golllld, dig for the gollld
Diiiig, for the gold
I'll be a rich man in China, b-b-b-before I grow old"

Behold, take heed, witness wisdom being dropped
MCs spilled their skills but they'll just get mopped
Early bird on the track, first up to bat
Throw a steak on the grill so I can chill and get fat
Heat up the coals while I heat up the mic
Competition, if they're a match then I'll strike
Wreck the shop, leave the shit in a shambles
Put your money on a sure shot, Benj ain't a gamble
I'll slap a muzzle on a sucker whose tongue skips
Give him the boot and turn his ass into dum chips
With what's left I'll fertilise the earth
You was bunk as an MC but your shit you bring birth
I walk a path to become legendary
Rhymes so milky they'll be labelled as dairy
Competition I just dispose of
Swift with the gift, the man all the hoes love
Slamming suckers like Bambam Bigelow
Got bitches on my team like I was a gigolo
I break hearts and I climb charts
And I never been booty, save that for the farts
Kids blowing hot air, who got their heads gassed?
You can have ten wack rappers and they still come in dead last
I watch them fall cause they're faulty
I laugh in their face and they walk away salty
I rain on suckers while some choose to drizzle
You come up with beef you leave with no teeth and gristle
Fuck with your head like Hannibal the Cannibal
Destroy your senses, turn you from man to manimal
Or better yet a marshmallow
Cause compared to me you're a walking bowl of Jell-O
He went out like Mark Hamill
So next time you kick a rhyme save that shit for the camel

[Merc]
Yeah, yeah, uh
Young Merc
For all my youg niggaz (All of my young niggaz)
On the block, Naa mean (On the block)
Going hard (Blow hard nigga)

Yo I was raised in poverty (in poverty)
Yeah, life was hard
Growin up 'round, killaz and hust-lers
I used ta, sit on the porch
Watch pops smoke luports
Trying when he was going to get his next bag to snort
I just sit back, deep in thought like (man)
Wishin I had a plan to make him a better man
But I can't, but that's what made it worse
Then I started smokin weed and hustlin work
I turned to the streets, fifteen, mind on cash
Highschool fliest nigga in the class
Why all y'all was studyin trying to pass
I was tryna, get the pass, to cut out and get ass
I was always ahead of my time
Neighbours in the hood said I be locked up
Or dead by twenty-five
But still I, Ride, wit my head high
Knowin I'm a young thug and I will survive

[Chorus: Merc]
I can't stop (I can't stop)
I gotta keep it movin (I gotta keep it movin)
Knowin this life I'm livin (Knowin this life I'm livin)
It's either death or prison (It's either death or prison)
Hard livin
(Repeat Once)

[D.O. Cannon]
Uh, the ghetto
We prayin, Lord
All of my thugs be given strength
POV Shitty
You ain't gotta show me love when I'm wearin the glove
And I just found out my man done chick slugs
And my man rever diss touch down
Means alot of niggaz on the streets ain't really gon eat right now
Man I'm so mad dog, I can't tell you why
If the Lord don't bow down I'll murder the damn sky
I'm to hot for this shit, please calm me down
I stay doing right, I stay doing wrong
I stay huggin my moms I lost in eighty-nine
I'm still bangin that nine I had since eighty-nine
You niggaz feelin my vibe?
Man it's hard to walk, man it's hard to talk
Dog I keep quiet
Cuz playas wear wires when we start to bring the riot
I'm tired of this shit, take me now
I'm gon be back in a minute dog don't hate me now
I heard the streets wanna smoke me
Dog, I'm to lokey
It's murda

[Chorus: Merc]
I can't stop (I can't stop)
I gotta keep it movin (I gotta keep it movin)
Knowin this life I'm livin (Knowin this life I'm livin)
It's either death or prison (It's either death or prison)
Hard livin
(Repeat Once)

[Black Child]
Word to god, Yeah
I was only twelve when I first went to jail
Locked up and sparked it, fucked up and heartless
My moms had a habit, heron and acid
A bad lil' basterd always needed my ass kicked
A five member family living in one room
Cookin on hot plates, eatin on plastic spoons
I don't esagerate, or imaginate
I had to go to jail to graduate
Growin up in Foster homes, You Fosters own
I had to get up, get out and get my own
Niggaz was throwin bricks I'm tossin stones
Then I floss the chrome, the boss is home
But the block is gone, the cops is wrong
Yellow got paralyzed, Little Jemel died
Put me in hell and I still rise
Put me in the chair I'll fry
Do my whole twenty-five

[Chorus: Merc]
I can't stop (I can't stop)
I gotta keep it movin (I gotta keep it movin)
Knowin this life I'm livin (Knowin this life I'm livin)

(Ooh
What you say
Come on)

My deejay is dope, def, real death-defyin
Competators, get with mental def tryin
The number one candidate, his hands'll make
Dancers dance, he possess the hands of fate
He'll scratch a record that will stand
Out from the rest that's def, and he'll jam
Anywhere at any given time and thrill fans
Totally blindfold his cuts will still slam
Harder than the average, make a savage kid
Nervous, the perfect combination had to get
Funkier than funk itself, now haven't you heard
He sharpens his claws for damagin a nerd
Just with the power, plus time to mutilate
You can't escape, don't even try to retaliate
Cee Just, do that shit, they thought you slipped
They didn't know that you were smoother than Cool Whip
Now prove it to em ( *cuts* ) scratch
Pull it back ( *cuts* ) yeah, I like that
Energetic, enthusiastic
Cuts are drastic, knowledge the tactics
Faster than a centipede. and all that he need 
Is two tables and a crossfader to make the record bleed
Deejay of the year, got the number one candidate
And he possess the hands of fate

(Disc jock)
(Come on)

Deejays left to right throw in their white flags
The way that he scratch you think the record had crashed
Back and forth, forth and back as he'll attack 
The turntable, that's why he's labelled an acrobat
You need to resign or take a spring break
First you was hard, now you're soft like a ice cream cake
Try to compete with the elite is a silly stunt
He'll smoke the crossfader like a Philly blunt
Manifest skills on the wheels of steel
The one-man band never ran, and he never will
He's a hitman, who's gonna be the next hit?
You wanna battle, you better bring your best shit
Courage, heart, balls, cuts
After all that you still get crushed like a wall nut
Damn, the brother's nice, I make em do a quicker slice
Sendin em toy deejays back to Fisher Price
Hard to categorize or analyze
The way that he scratch leave deejays paralyzed
Crisp and clean like a fully loaded magazine
The track is mean, he's prepared to rag a teen
Deejay Cee Just, he cuts, you couldn't beat us 
Even if you were to cheat us
Stun ya, make you wonder how can he make
A record rag so much, he got the hands of fate

(He's Cee Just)

Sharper than a straight blade are my rhyme skills
They attack with the impact of a minefield
And I ain't even started to get loose yet
Turn up your Alpine, e.q. your gooseneck
Ladies say "aw!", fellas say "ho!"
Prepare to undergo 
Lyrical surgery, you're gonna get hit, slayed
Rhymes'll crack your spine and bust your rib cage
I can't calculate the rappers I take out
Before the battle is through, most of them break out
I never lose, I aim to win
I'm just a rebel, killin like a Devil Tasmanian
To take a deejay out is a bear task
Who's def, he'll make you lose your breath like tear gas
Just, cut it up, cold smash the break
Show the people you possess the hands of fate

Alright EZ Elpee session, artist Mike Zoot
Label Guesswhyld
*soft ad lib for 10 seconds*

Yo, up in my mixed drink session, heaven got a ghetto
In orange and tango, eyes red low and mellow
My squint look Tokyo, movin ill slow
My toned rebel, accented like Rachel, voice nasal
Now fix my levels, adjust me two notches, mic's to cable
Produce new paradise through poetics, slum fables
Turnin the bump tables, access a new address
In the rap race runnin the fastest, you'll never catch us
So when I pass the test, pass the rest, I'm passin out pamphlets
with my face on the front, drink or chase with the blunt
Spoken proverb, the new word, observin you herds
You just an ass, ??? ??? ??? sparked in the corner, I kick the kerb
The condominium in the next millennium
for my kids' kids' kids and then multiplied to the max, no minimum livin
Caribbean tints, strokin my wall, woman and ism
New comer, young jungalist on the rhythm with a vision
I'm trippin, still for kickin and spittin

	[Chorus]
	So we can  - EAT GOOD
	Drinkin 	     - SMOKE GOOD
	Burnin        - BLACK TREES
	Wrapped in - BLACK WOOLS
	QUARTO'S (Quarto's), HOLD YA NOSE
	Freshed dippin - IN NEW CLOTHES
	So now we live - HOW WE SUPPOSE AND IT GOES

Yo pour some liquors on the ground for my niggas not around
And hit the whole cup, straight down, Absolut and Crown
Order another round, I'm clownin wild for the evenin
Good greetins, I bring it with lye and etcete-rah
The down-the-block, better than Best Buy, come check I
for the hook up, ring the bell then look up for the what's up
I puts up, stacks in all columns
Operatin from the bottom, Bed-Stuy Brooklyn wit mad problems
Bringin ???? out their ears and kick a freestyle for pay
New Gz, different peer, different year for each day
Stayin decent, special gear drycleanin
Floss and mean it, I seened it like a dream in doin cheebas
Only that much, drinkin so on and such
Thinkin with a Dutch, headrush and touch cuts
Bust nuts in different countries and I only been there once
but I'm going back next month and yo you need to come with me
I'm gonna take us

	[Chorus]
	So we can  - EAT GOOD
	Drinkin 	     - SMOKE GOOD
	Burnin        - BLACK TREES
	Wrapped in - BLACK WOOLS
	QUARTO'S (Quarto's), HOLD YA NOSE
	Freshed dippin - IN NEW CLOTHES
	Now we live - HOW WE SUPPOSE AND IT GOES, EAT GOOD

Catch me creepin through the fog, deep in through the smog
It's the number one nigga in your hood with no job
Who schooled you, just that, all rappers ackin Hollywood
Spittin flames on the game they call me Zoot Eastwood
North face with the hood, Ma your son done good
But add the injury to the insult, second year same coat
Lighter note different stroke, I been been broke
For the gas we go, never no outlaw so I move this boat
The wholesale rap grail, feel what I see
See my dot dot dash men, the basement bash men
Keepin no attachments, just eat, run and tell
all about the smell of new money back from hell
Here the highway, heaven is, just got paid
on Friday, leanin sideway, my high don't stay
Til I fill up my dinner tray, with meals ridiculous
The ticket, yo yo, this is it for written and kickin shit
Cheese and chicken shit, lickers and bigger spliffs
Excuse me Miss, hit this, I shoot, give generous
Straight faced serious, drivin you delirious
Live in stereo so you can hear it, ya hear it?

	[Chorus]
	So we could  - EAT GOOD
	Drinkin 	       - SMOKE GOOD
	Burnin          - BLACK TREES
	Wrapped in   - BLACK WOOLS
	QUARTO'S (Quarto's), HOLD YA NOSE
	Freshed dippin - IN NEW CLOTHES
	And how we live? - HOW WE SUPPOSE

	And it goes  - EAT GOOD
	Drinkin 	      - SMOKE GOOD
	Burnin         - BLACK TREES
	Wrapped in  - BLACK WOOLS
	QUARTO'S (Quarto's), HOLD YA NOSE

* numerous intro chatter for 20 seconds - hard to transcribe *
  
Hip-hop nowadays seems different to me
Everybody's bustin a shot or flippin a ki
Is it real? (Hell yeah) Well it isn't to me
It seems a lot of these wack rappers are livin for free
With their talk-about name tags, designer frames and bags
Peruvian coke connects that they never had, huh
Dressed up videos co-starring De Niro
To them ghetto dwellers, you label street heroes
THAT'S A SHAM! Don't get caught out there man
They'll put a bullet in your temple just as quick as they can
then they'll scram, you're nothin but a stuttered out, piece of flesh
in the next man's GS I guess
All that tough talk on wax ain't according to many facts
It was a facade you put on, when your lawyer got your contracts
And the way you went down got me heated
Your presence in hip hop ain't needed so beat it, uh yeah huh
You ain't needed in the hip hop game
You ain't doin nuttin for my brain
And all you rappers really sound the same
You ain't needed in the hip hop game
You ain't needed in the hip hop game
You ain't doin nuttin for my brain
And all you rappers really sound the same
Yeah yeah yeah, you's a real tough niggaro
Back in '80-somethin I saw you dancin in the videos
Frontin hard, for the AV squad
In high school, you was just a branded fool
Dressin preppy, you must've ate too much spaghetti
Flash forward a decade now your last name's Guiseppi
Allegedly, runnin with those crooked nose kids
but when you turn your back they'll shoot a hole through your leg
As you skid (AARGH!) out of control on the Grand Central
You gotta call that your label would fall
If you put your, toughest, hardest, realest
MCs against me they'll turn up empty HAH
Cos they don't know nothin bout real rap skills
so there presence ain't needed for real so what the deal? Yeah
You ain't needed in the hip hop game
You ain't doin nuttin for my brain
And all you rappers really sound the same
You ain't needed in the hip hop game
You ain't needed in the hip hop game
You ain't doin nuttin for my brain
And all you rappers really sound the same
Hah
Now this goes to the fan that really thinks the man
behind the mic is speakin truth, but yo I got proof
There's about seventy precent of rappers who misrepresent (What?)
talkin about they'll put a dent (What?) in the game when they drop
but don't even scratch the surface, rhymin without a purpose
makes me sick to my stomach, so you suckers should stop
It's a sign of the times, a kilo ain't got nothin to do with your rhymes
A gun ain't got nothin to do with your rhymes
A blunt ain't got nothin to do with your rhymes, that's why you fall behind
So next time you braggin bout the dues you completed
Remember your presence ain't needed, now hit the hell out of here, huh yeah
You ain't needed in the hip hop game
You ain't doin nuttin for my brain
And all you rappers really sound the same
You ain't needed in the hip hop game
You ain't needed in the hip hop game
You ain't doin nuttin for my brain
And all you rappers really sound the same
You ain't needed in the hip hop game

[Ronnie Spencer]
You know, you got hope
Though, you make me dry
A candy coated Cadillac, that's what I drive
Rolling on 20's, screens falling from the back falling
You may not have, that mansion
Or that forty football rush, I know you want them
You may not have, expensive jewelry
Or that mink coat, it feels so fine
But the one thang, I know you have
That one thang, is hope I see you got hope

[Hook: Ronnie Spencer]
When a man's in the rough, help a brother up
Give a little love, you can't get enough ooh-ooooh
Never give up, when times get rough
Cause living in the streets, man you gotta be tough ooh-ooooh

[Noke D]
See I'ma help a nigga out, that's the way I was raised
From the old school days, see we done turned the page
We ain't tripping no mo', cause see we all about the do'
You see us whipping in the Bentley, or a six double O
O Benz, me and my friends
Always share the ball, even when it's fourth and ten
I play the game to win, steady setting trends
We pray together, we gon stay together like we was first to kin
Man, it's going down
Gotta make a change, see that's all that's on my mind
Fuck being fine, gotta walk a straight line
Time after time, I'ma keep my mind on the grind I ain't lying

[Tyte Eyez]
It was blood sweat and tears, I shed many for my peers
It was rough in the ghetto, for my people where I lived
I'm trying to get my family out the hood, I know that I will
A young nigga chasing dreams, show my skills to pay bills
I keep my faith in God, he gon make it happen
To get my brother that coupe my sister the Jag, my T that mansion
And to my G's on the block, we bout to switch it legal
I'm tried of seeing you boys, hustling in them hot ass Regals for real

[Ronnie Spencer]
Now that I, paid my dues
Doors stay open, now it's choices to choose
Help my brother, so that he helps me
So when I stand tall, he stand next to me
And if I ever fall, he catches me
Together we gon ball, till I D-I-E
And if I ever fall, he catches me
Together we gon ball, till I D-I-E

[Hook - 2X]

(Ronnie Spencer)
Gotta hold on, to what you got yeah
Oh I know you know I know, you gotta hold on
Even when this world is tough baby, everybody

Never-never give up, hold on-hold on
Won't you hold on, hold on
Won't you hold on, hold on yeah

Woke up at dawn got a page at five ten
Head still spinnin' off that Gatorade and gin
Stumbled to the bathroom, picked up my mobile phone
Hit power plus the digits now I'm waitin' for roam
Um shook my dick and on the line came Master P

[Master P]
I said what up Bo, I got a lick on some keys
And we gon' do this shit like G's so meet me in the Bay
I quarter mill in caine fool, so bring ya HK
And get cho' gloves cause you gonna get cho' hands dirty
Leave them fools trippin' I mean cold turkey
And bring yo gat cause we gonna break em' to they knees
And like you say Bo rat-heads get nothin' but cheese
And don't forget to bring an ounce of that sticky dank
So we be high as a bird as we hoo-ride on this gank

[Hook x3: Master P]
Headin' for the jack, strapped with the fat gat
Bo and Master P down to rat-tat-tat-tat

[C-Bo]
Got off the phone, been on for a half-hour
Dropped my draws hopped off and took a shower
Stepped out, put on my Guess and some K-Swiss
Backed my Regal off the grass on to the pavement
Hit I-80, west bound to Rich Town
Strapped with the HK-40 ready to put that track down
Spittin' that fire and niggas be retirin'
Runnin' up for application when some niggas ain't hirin'
I'm on a mission, takin' mine and gettin' yours
Like I settled for, it's nothin' but that hardcore
Me and Master P done hooked up on a murder hit
Two niggas hoppin' off in the drop-top straight servin' shit
So fools, break yourself drop me off or get dealt with
AK cocked, one pop will make ya belt rip
I'm in it to win, can't no nigga get away from the murder one rap
And we out to get some so it's best if you ride around with ya strap

[Hook x3]
Dope in the car, they let the dogs loose to hound me
I'm headin' for the county, a hundred g's for my fuckin' bounty
Cause I'm a killer with no heart
Mass murderin' fools bout to amputate they body parts
Like Jeffrey Dahmer, that ain't no drama
So here's yo ghetto pass, a one-way ticket to the Bahamas
Ain't no love bitch, I thought chu' knew me
I sit with this ho and these 32 kids, that nickel-plated uzi
Master P and Bo is headed for that big jack
Movin' to get cho' face cracked, infrared to yo back
Should I shoot, get him for his loot
No wait might hit him for his whole motherfuckin' suit
Shoot em' up bang bang, gotta let my nuts hang
Lettin' off rounds in my candy painted Mustang
Hit a lick for some snow and did a drive-by
Sliced it up and slanged it up on the setlike some Muslim bean pies
Hit the highway with Bo back to the 916
Left the 510 cause we gon' double up to 26
Bumpin' 2Pac, motherfuckin' "Thug Life"
Reminicin' on our dead homies all fuckin' night
It was a drought so we crawdad
I mean up the price cause this shit was movin' too fuckin' fast
Gats cocked for the jackers
Rollin' with the shackers
Got this ho in the back talkin' shit, I just might smack her
Pull over sideways I had to let the top down
Dank comin' out the car like steam comin' off the ground
Now we on our way to Burbank
To the 213 and like B-Legit say it's gon' take three tanks
So pull this motherfuckin' hog to the Philly station
Start the grapevine, seen this fool slippin' on triple gold Daytons

[Hook x3]

[C-Bo]
Doors down, got an extra clip for the HK fifteen rounds
Adrenaline pumpin' as I lay everybody face down
Should I kill them, no fill the bag
He had more cash stashed off in the drop Jag
Slammed his hand in the door, torture will make him speak
Cocked my hammer, jammed my barrel through his fuckin' teeth
Got him coughin' up, pissin' blood
Cause a ballin' ass nigga didn't show no love
Nigga, motherfuckers be gettin' they head twisted
Ya best homeboy done turned into a rat, snitch, bitch
Got cha' jacked slapped caught up in the rat pack
While some niggas in all black, in some fake D.A. hats
Jumpin' out of rental cras, up on ya front yard
Runnin' through yo front door holdin' the four-four
Yellin' jack time, crack minds
And put this shit on record cause I can back mine

Uh-huh, KB's, yeah

[Armel]
Think you faster than a bullet, if you can, let him live
If you can't, tell his kids, daddy need to exercise
Couldn't let him slide, though, patience is a virtue
Leave it up to Christ to hurt you, nah, I'd rather do it
And I'll talk to him later, creation to creature
You don't deserve your physical, death is one syllable
Devil I consider you a waste of space
So smart that you stupid final resting place
I'm small, dark hole where your body turn cold
And your spirit, start to wonder, and your family, start to ponder
Where the hell is my son, I'm home cleaning a gun
They ain't seen him in 80 days, until he reached front page

[12 O'Clock]
Sick time to shut it on 'em
I bought 'em for my police officer granddaughter
We feed 'em gun powder, put dust in they water
I'm out in Florida, sniffing cocaine by the quarter
I'm in the strip club in Mexico, next to the border
Getting head from this pretty chick, sitting in the corner
Where we looking real rich, so they pushing up on her
Me and P burning kush, got them burners on us
And it's cold outside, got them snorkels on us
And it's Wu, muthafuckas, how the fuck do you want it?

[Chorus 2X: The Reverend William Burk]
They say we no damn good, they say we too damn hood
I say I'm misunderstood, come follow me if you would
And step into the mind of a madman, with cash plans
To stack grands, dirty dollars to pass hands

[Prodigal Sunn]
Yeah, I know you feeling us, the return of the Killa Beez
Another trilogy, twisting up vanilla leaves
I peel a hundred D's, we leaving with metal reefs
Settle like some cheese, mellow off some green tea
Deep as biology, ladies wanna follow me, swallow me
Addicted to my lively psychology, P
The ace in the pocket, I'm always on target
You want it, I got it, fire like the fuel from a rocket, uncock it
The lock and the key, many rocks in the sea
But G-O-D be the Clan of the century
A hundred grand for every man, we living it up
Yo, cash in the cup, let the fans know what's up

I guess I troop, honey, what the scoop?  You're kinda cute
Your man is John Recoup, same as my climbing boot
Blase blase blah, I'm not a star, I don't have a car
Fuck all the chatter, you cannot have the bra
Peep the framework, see if the game work
Heard she gave my man Hurt, the same dirt
on the same skirt, as the week passed; It's like
the freak fast, catchin whiplash when them Jeeps pass
Throw on the switch just to get rich; call you hon
before I bag it after that it's chickenhead bitch
I only got the digits when I met you; Tootsie had a Benz-y
boned your friends and got some head too
?? hoes, don't doze cause the mic goes
pop, when I rock all these silly psychoes
But that's another matter, this ain't a love chatter
So I can ?? rock and duck ?? rumps that's fatter
Like, I know we're slickin, right at the stoplight
Pulled the Jag up, you get bagged up like this was Shop-Rite
I guess it's all that, layin like doormats..peed
When I make this hit you try to catch me
I told her, ?nine-sixty years? all the papers near
Now I need me a gasmask til all these vapors clear
for hours, with all her powers just to see how
your Range Rover feel, on the real, that's head over wheels

Chorus: G-Depp

So what's the deal huh?  Let's keep it real huh?
You like these wheels huh?  Tell me how they feel huh?
Head over wheels huh...
... uhh, head over wheels huh, uhh

Yo honey bust it let's discuss it for a little bit
I know the middle stick, so GO HEAD with your little tits
A nigga rollin in the car from taggin, lookin tight ragged
On the night racket, concoctin Reeboks and the flight jacket
But that's OK cause when you play there's a price to pay
A small way, tend to hallways, twice a day
Don't front though, I make the flow through the gut slow
or the butt, ohh, made her scream like I struck gold
That's cold, better yet it's freezin, honey steady teasin
Tis the season for skeezin, no teasin just some heavy breathin
Hoe pros and when she blows, only heaven knows
No clothes, ohh!  Got that fifty-four-eleven though
That trick, I guess I tricked for this pair of kicks
Just to gas em have her girlfriends askin can we share his dick
Divide it equally, and dick it frequently, they always beepin me
We do this secretly, so yeah don't speak to me
Get noid with Floyd, creep up the backstreet ain't that sweet
You don't see them hookers in this backseat
Time and time to get the bump n grind, I guess love is blind
Or he caught you in your eye with his brother's nine
I'd rather use my know of flicks, and the known face
Watch em plead just to get them keys on your court date
Hon Dawn got it goin on, since you're gone pal
Your man Shawn get the horn now, pow

Chorus 2X

I lift this honey in the air, like no gravity
Cause of her thoughts, now she's in the porch of her sanity
So as you enter, since you commence to
play the roll you gon' play the coal in the winter
And if you get another fuck it, fuckin
no less than her circumfrence then I'm hosted in another bucket
I be the one to pass by ya with the cash kinda, crass
You still behind that ass in my Pathfinder
Tryin to front like she fond-of, niggaz and ganja
Til I pull ups-on-ja, wild, forget the menage-a-trois
in the car with Rhonda, hittin the tits
She smell herself, cause she sell herself like Honda's
These bitches is bugged, all thugged out
Cause I told her the ride was over GET THE FUCK OUT
Get your Lugz out and get to walkin, that's how the wind blows
Power windows so I can't hear the shit you talkin
You wanna drive stick, combine my prize with
chinky eyes with ?lilet? all that old fly shit
But wake up, without makeup, and get the clear view
Only place I'll be seein you is in the rearview

[Sinister]
You might have seen me in the drop-top convertible Lex
So what the heck
I'm test to murder hood dweller
A good fella represents
Never hesitant to put the weight between your eyes
44 pounds of steel, real niggas recognize
I kill at will like Q, tell me who's getting rude
My click is some fools, thugs, and pimps, and playas too
Got homies in grey and blue and got niggas in black
I'll put a slug in his back and still ask him where your glove at
Now he bustin' back, I must come strapped cause it's combat
All the dust these niggas kicking we been there and done that
Naw, fuck that
We rep on the track like World Order
And we got the bombest shit, nigga like Pearl Harbor
I just wish that I could manslaughter (Who)
The hater, are ya in danger of another killer stranger
Guess it's banger, check his chamber
Scaring niggas at night, demonizing their mind
Sneek up from behind, now is it Mr. Mike

[Hook]
In the heat of the night
Ain't no time for stage fright
You might make the front page if your game ain't tight
So keep your hand on your glock and get paid tonight
It don't stop and Goodfellas is what I claim for life
In the heat of the night
Ain't no time for stage fright
You might make the front page if your game ain't tight
I got my sacks in my pocket and at least a grand
Gold on my neck, my pistol's close at hand

[Sinister]
Vision me in the cut, middle corrupt and never giving a fuck
My verbal slang making niggas gangbang and blaze up
Hanging out the Range Rover with a hangover
Test me, I'm deadly like Ebola, just another ghetto soldier
Best be in the mist of the smoke, when niggas choke
Fake thug niggas and drug dealers is getting revoked
I left the world comatose from the streets of the East to the West Coast
It's that Dirty South killer that you heard about
Suave took a murder route, I got your broad bout to turn her out
She did my whole crew, can't fuck you she burnt out
In my third house converting dominos, swirving the Rolls
Blessed, still dressed in mafia clothes
A cold blooded killer, a Southwest connect dealer
Cruising for a bruising half Cuban, half nigga
Blast quicker than any gun clapper on the mappa
From MC to OG I'm the one they coming after

[Hook]

[Kadabi]
Dark as the night, pitch black as the sky
Dark as the AK, black skin means you die
Wonder why night time is the wrong time you can get called up to Heaven
Now we bailing, selling
Through the streets only in the PM
Kadabi notifies mister so we could see him
In the back of our gambling shacks, straight yak
Conversation with macks about stacks and counter-attacks

[Corleone]
I got a sack in my pocket and at least a G
You couldn't see from close range, slang like cocaine
More game than a Phoenix who fiend who reign supreme
Continue the saga, we bring the drama to the scene
We scheming in the heat of the night
Pulling the heist between the lights
Of street dwellers, G-fella for life, my game tight
Hard to explain this Corleone and Sinister
And Kadabi, you can't spot us in the heat of the night

[Hook] (x2)

Ahhh, in the heat of the night, in the heat of the night
G-fellas, quiet like church mice, and it don't stop
This shit real, know what I'm saying this shit is like do or die
Goodfellas live fly ha ha, know what I'm saying
My nigga Corleone, Kadabi, and the Sinister, G-fellas
Mashing and bashing, blasting and broading ha ha

Song:   Help Me Out
Typed by: Nelson2014@aol.com

Verse 1:

Mack Del impetuous
Tepetuous 
Bust flows ?
Under fire like appestos
All MCs grip my testicles
Let them go
No, I spread your flow like metal pull
Utensils such as scalpels 
Over your Adam's Apple
To make you alto 
Doggin' MCs and feed 'em Alpo
Your plan backfires to my satires
Got your flow sittin' on flat tires
My rogues rhymes rip through your lip when you bite
Like a lightenin' bolt for a volt of molten mite
Hazardiest to the average
Volt and death strike 
To your neck right 
On target
Bull's eye 
Then deflected off your neck with such velocity
It's sets the hip hop hostage free
In the terminal burnin' all MC's brains
Excellerated agents got you walkin' on canes
I'll be brief like Hanes
Mundane MCs get caned to retain my title
The vital organ donor 
To cut through the bonona
My escapes let you wave through the masquerade
Rain with disaster man out in your play book 
Cause they took
The funk merged with hate
And then regurgitate 
This concludes part of what causes murder rates to bubble
Meanwhile I take the shuttle to this girls crib so we can cuddle
And listen to my subtle rebuttal the butthole

Hook:
Words and phrases I prefer to play with
When occurs when I made it 
It's never outdated
Help me out (x2)

Verse 2:
I stifle your mic hold your grips slips don't let all your chips 
Throwin' away all your tips for thinkin'
That's dangerous
Leave that to the big boys
Sicker than Sig Freud
Peep, you wanna live forever but take too many chances 
You with many can get a piece of eastside Oakland folks 
When provokin' spoken dialects of broken English 
that distinguish us from y'all we 
Cause raps and own spots on the globe
And disrobe your bony mediocrity like Socrates
My Egyptian inscription shiftin' 
Brain cells with sick inflections
Suckas must be simpin'
Hop like Lipton
You'll get the microphone when I'm though if then
I form a rap court with my siblings 
The sort of thing that keep the crew tight
Even in it's new life
You think you're able to label the Hiero sound?
You still haven't found a comparable variable
I aim my flows they close in like smart bombs
Bury ya restricted areas
Me and my playmates we talented hip hop palatines
Patteling' to Sharlintons 
Knownin' what we are to them 
Makes us try hard to win
We attend the track promptly 
Rappers wanna chomp me
They empty 
I'm mega morph with mega force don't fort deceit the beat i
I's a treat
Compete at the war on the weak

Hook

Verse 3:
Del carelessly convorting
Over more things than tracks 
Your skull perhaps 
Spinal taps vinyl laps over each other  you'll discover 
oon enough how tough it is to scruff them bids
At accsions I'm lost in madness
Lacadazical but coming back to fade you ALL
I don't make music for the teeny boppers the coppers and proper booshy
Y'all can lose me 
Or find me but keep in mind we
Underground when you get offended 
As you often do when you new comers
Check the rap scene for a few summers
Then when it change you shift lanes 
But first you mergin' 
First you was a virgin splurgin' money on P.E.
Then with N.W.A. 
But too much trouble to play
Mom on your ass turn that trash down
Your little brother getting' bright ideas in the background
He use to war Hush Puppies 
Now he and his homies is dust junkies sellin' crack cross country 
Use to be a momma's boy
Now you a grown man with no plan
All alone in the land of the free and the home of the brave
Free to be your own mental slave
Del has to have a word with you 
Because you deserve to do what you want to
But mistakes come back to haunt you

[Ese Daz]
Lil' Blue is in the casa
Ace, is in the casa
Cino
Is in the casa
Puttin' it down, for the raza
Yeah, it's Lil' Blue
With my homies in the house, with my familia
Ha ha, check it out

[Verse 1: Ese Daz]
Boom
Here comes another bomba
Lil' Blue with L.O.L., smoking out the mota
Trucha, when we roll through your fuckin' city
Better run and hide and make a phone call to the Fedi'
The juras, the blackas, that'll always harass the raza
I'm always on my toes, lookin' out for el ratas
On the freeway, doin' 95
Hit the 405 north to the Club Mile High
On the dance floor, sippin' zombies
With, three, four, five, freaks, freakin' on me
And jealous vatos get mad, cause they know I'm the man
Taking the hoes' home, havin' bubblebaths
Homie, don't playa-hate me
Congradulate me
I know it's hard cause I fucked your lady
So forget about the past and keep your eyes on the present
Lil' Blue is on the prowl, so lock your hoe in the basement

Chorus:
[Sample]  "Here's a little story, I got to tell
          About three bad brothers, you know so well" --> Mike D. (Beastie Boys)

          Three for the Fedi, and four for 3-1-0

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 2)
(Cino in background)
[Ace]     Come along, hurry hurry
          Before the show begins
          Jump in the ride with three loco Mexicans
          Got a bottle of gin, with a pocket full of Ben's
          Headed up the hill, to the spot, Coaquin
[Cino]    Flossin' in the club, see the ladies in the crap
          I walk up to one, I said
          "I can make ya bounce"
          She said, "I don't do it enough"
          I do it in the Coup
          So I freak the honies, then I call in the truce
[Ace]     Come on, come all (It's on)
          Freak til ya fall
[Cino]    Got the pannies drippin' wet
[Both]    And I'm killing you soft
[Ace]     So rough, so tough, but you not, getting enough
[Cino]    Double A is some trouble
[Both]    When Triple A is too much
[Cino]    Who want to run with the L.O.L. and the Lil' Blue
[Both]    The truce
[Cino]    From this
[Ace]     Loco Latin groove
[Cino]    How and where it all began, you'll never even know
[Ace]     Lil' Blue, put it down
[Ese Daz] H.A., 3-1-0

Repeat Chorus Twice

[Verse 3: Ese Daz (Ace in background)]
Now you know, homies, my clique is the shit
Mafiosos Arellanos making dead presidents
It's a Familia here, so ain't no set trippin'
Got each other's back for life
Motherfucker, til we die
It's a loco Latin thing
Where we swang
C-Arson City, rest in peace to Lil' Pee Wee
A little shoutout to my homie
Keep your memory alive, pour some here out a 40 
And roll out in my '79 glass house
Got some bitches waiting for me out my nephew Ace's house (Yeah)
Everybody's partyin' down, hoochies looking good
With little shorts on, dancin', drinkin', booze gone
And everything is going right tonight
It's already one o'clock and ain't no cops in sight
So it's on (It's on)
So hit the bong (Bring it on)
And listen to the hook as the historia goes on

Repeat Chorus Twice

(Sample in background)
[Ese Daz] Yeah ("Here's a little story, I got to tell")
          Yeah

        Sayin' every little thing to get you wet between the thighs
        I'm a player
        Droppin' up game for the triple
        Out to make a grip out of shiny dime and nickel
[Chiko] Hey lady
[Rebel] Move a little closer, shorty
        Let's shake up the party cause it's time to get naughty
        On the real
        This is how I feel
        I give up a mil, just so I could steal
        A second of your time and let you feel the passion of a thug

[Verse 2: Dominator]
Move a closer
Let me connect
Dig up in your valley
Touch you where you're wet
All the right spots, we connecting all them dots
We been smoking on that pot, baby, please forget-me-not
I know you got plans and I know you got places
You wanna go too, but you keep making these faces
That make me wanna ask you to stay
And be my lady
Do a lot of screwin'
But not have many babies
Me and you, baby girl, against the world
I'm not askin' you to give me nothin'
Plain and simple, girl
Unless you want the Dominator to break it down, way down
Turn your punani into a smile from a frown
I'm not supposed to be so nasty
But I can't help myself
Thinking of how you could jab me
Of course, you the one, who else
Got them soft hands
I could smell the funk in your fingernails

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 3: Madogg]
You'se a class act woman
Beautiful baby
Song in my head, ringin' "Who's that lady?"
Tell me your name
Forget your number
A drink on me, let's get to know one another
Sippin' on Cris
Champagne
Beautiful soft skin, your body's callin' my name
I'll give you everything, I need nothin'
All I want is to show you my lovin'
I ain't bluffing
I'll give you the world
There ain't no limit
If you was my girl
Drink that ice, you look nice and sexy
Naughty little grin, lookin' sweet and nasty
I'm happy
For this very night
Starlit sky clearing up to take flight
To ecstacy, girl
You and me
The love is strong til eternity
Hey lady

Typed by: fridgepnufc@hotmail.com

	[Intro/Hook - x2]
	From the high degrees to the low degrees
	Ice cold, red hot, you can burn the freeze

Fahrenheit, very low
Icicle, hail storm, below zero
Temperature, closed doors, wet conditions are unhealthiest
Weather war, about minus four Celsius
Sky's presence, absence of solar there
Snow's essence, existence of polar bears
Only strong survive in this habitat
Forever off and on, life is a thermostat
Will you melt? Apply with the belt tractor
Still you felt my style's wind chill factor
In a pack of rappers, actual, natural disaster
Raps that go faster than wind speed
Tracks by the masters indeed
The season for freezin and green need
Dog sled stampede by the freezed slave calvary
I relieve those updated, cowardly fools never made it, through the art

	[Hook - x2]

Fire logs, oven on
Hot metal, hot wax, brimstone
In a hell hole, sell your soul for the go
Burn rubber, burn blunts, burn coals
for the smell-good, tales from the hood well understood, so
hot I shook the spot to pop a squad on this block
Pressure cooker pot, to know the time look at her watch
for the boiling point, evaporation and your life stops
You bring the heat they can't believe that (They can't believe that)
They gathered together the flare up, tear up and bring the heat back
Like modern day Nat Turner's with black burners
Everybody gotta heater and we'll burn ya
Just like Kilbey's for loin cloth
Cocktail tusk, not a roof is lit
Hell we don't need no water, burn down the shit
Seems ain't nobody quiet in a riot
My amp is HOT, high voltage in my WATTS
Blowin up the spot, blow up your radio box
See me with the bingin, steamin like an engine
Can't take the heat get out of the kitchen quick bitch

	[Hook - x2]

	High degrees to the low degrees
	Ice cold, red hot, you can burn the freeze
	(From the) High degrees to the low degrees
	Ice cold, red hot, you can burn the freeze

I burn blunts with my Gz............

Some of this high...music

[Verse 1]
Fire up the vega, and listen to this playa gangsta
I been in this game for one year, but man I'm on my way to the tip
Flipped the script along time ago when I was young
Eleven years old and learned how to flip the tongue and had them sprung
Tried to tell them foos the last time
They shouldn't have let young gangsta get up on the mic up in the past time
I was taught to hit it, and make it last
Playa from the past, and had the ladies on the dance floor shakin that ass
Reminiscin on '91, beatin on the walls of juvenile hall
Pushin my button til' this bitch broke and ask her to make a head call
They rushed a brotha and he took a fall
I seen my homie and he tell a nigga stand tall
I seen my brother in the gym and I give him dap
Then bust a few freestyle's to let him know I rap
I said when I get out of this A-Y Six I'm finna be makin music
Pick up a mic and show these suckas how to use it
Let's hit the highway

[Chorus 2X]
One day I was headed for the highway
Gettin high as a bird, high as a bird
One day I was headed for the highway
Gettin high as a bird, I think it was a Friday

[Verse 2]
Kickin back, unexplainable to the eye
Chillin off in the cuts, makin everybody think that I'm shy
But I'm a true to life, laid back gangsta draw the line
Respect for every young black man, cuz us black men been through hard times
My hard rhymes create a bond
Within the strange environment
I be livin in, tryin to get the dividends
Keepin it real, at the same time gotta keep my name up
Absorb it like a life size sponge
Gotta keep my game up, came up
From a long way
Cuz back in the days, they used to say, you aint gone never come up and
make it big Gangsta Dre
That's what they thought
That's what they talked
But when this raw uncut game hit the streets
I'm knowin that's what they thought
man it's a, cold world up on these streets of mine
If these youngsters aint out jackin, they made out on the grind
Cloud 1-9 is my state of mind
Stick to the code or comense to pay your fine
Let's hit the highway

[Chorus 2X]

Think it was a Friday
Gettin high as a bird, think it was a Friday

Intro:

You don't understand, nigga
Come into this West, Coast
First, up, C-No-Gee

Verse 1: C-No-Gee, Crazy Tee

I rip it like a black rhino, do your vinyl on your bulletproof vest
I, leave you in a wet mess
I see some enemy and they want some static
I got my Mossberg and Tee got an automatic
So now you know it's on til the break of day
AK's are bein pull out and pointed all kind of ways
And anybody can die even from a bullet ricochet
So let the dead lay where they lay

Let the live keep on livin, don't be a victim
Nine millimeter like em
Stick em, ha ha hah, stick em, mine's be on focus
Ready for that hocus pocus
Like an illusionist, Houdini
is gonna need more than three wishes from a genie to see me
Music master causin disasters, like the Joker
I'ma play ya like dominoes and poker

Chorus: (x4)

Hocus pocus, I think ya better focus
Crazy Tee and C-No-Gee is bringin game, causin ruckus

Interlude:

Uhh
We ain't finished with this motherfucker
Punk ass niggas better watch theyself

Verse 2: C-No-Gee

In L.A. County is where you will find me
In my hood, homey, not in the Valley
Sippin on some rum liquor
Bout to get dum-diddy, dum-diddy, dum-diddy-dum (Redrum)
As I keep gettin hyper and hyper like a fuckin sniper
sittin on the rooftop, gettin ready to buck your top
Laughin as I see your punk ass drop
Blue Adidas wearin, 380 packin
Matter of fact, men be crippled cos I'm crackin
down on a sucker trooper, be 3 to under
I'm stuffin, sucker motherfuckers in the oven
So ring the alarm, I think not
I see your punk ass drop as I clock
I keepin it on the real and I put that on my momma
I'ma have to kill your ass like that nigga did Jeffrey Dahmer

Chorus

Bringin game, causin ruckus
Ruckus, bringin game, causin ruckus
Crazy Tee and C-No-Gee is bringin game, causin ruckus

Verse 3: Crazy Tee, C-No-Gee

Never losin my focus, gun shots sound like locusts
And this ain't no hocus pocus, and even the locest
soldier's getting tested, pistol flarin
No time for foul strain cos ain't nobody carin
Whether it live or breathe it's just another pop pop pop and blow in the
breeze
Just make sure your gun don't freeze
Cos the mentality ya got ta have when you're rollin in South Central
Where most of the brothers you gon' come across ain't gentle
Ain't dumpin in work, or ready to put in work
It ain't worryin about none of these tricks in these skirts
They straight puttin they grind on everyday
Plottin out killings with AK's and, you know, all kind of ways

All kinds of ways, puttin in work on that caper for that paper
So let bullshit, you're catchin vapors, you can save it
You know it calls to be the boss in this game
So when you hand ya dues, it's a must that you cross the crossroads
And make sure you choose the right road

You choose the right road, don't go to hell, will pave the good intentions
Let me mention, it's Crazy Tee and C-No-Gee for life

[Big Gipp]
Look out the sun is out while its raining
The devils wife must be complaining
Remember that? its brothers work
Elbows in and up and down the court
Cause they play ball long after dark at Sykes park
Smelled the rain before it came
But that don't stop the game
Intense inside the twelve feet fence
Flip the mode back on the road set in
And watch my woodgrain spin
I let my window down and let the world in
Since I was knee high the only thing we had was the peachtree plaza in the sky
Things ain't the same no more
Everyday my city seems to grow and grow
Gotta blow a bed for my back
Cause I can't take the hardwood floors
Crooked system had me working in the warehouse
from 8 to 4 so
Gipp know what it is to work for them foes for a check that don't mean shit
More bills keep coming in
But ain't no saving
Used to scrape up a buck for a box of newports
But after I found out
That they was fucking with the tobac I stopped
Its like killing myself with a glock (pow)
Its rough
Prices going up people giving in
To the rockets and hernon homes is known
By the city to be toxic but ain't nothin said
Always on the down low never in the mainstream
It ain't king
To be the fulltime
Blow a man these days you get years
And even though..
My cousin writes me from the pen
I always think about how we kicked it at the Dungeon fo' he went in
What's next?
My slick partner Toby is gone
Went to handle a little business never made it back home
I wonder what his girl told his son.......
Hold on

[T-Mo]
I can't escape the bullshit
Where ever I go shit
Always into something cause I wanna be rich
Pulling cards in my blood it seems I'm mean cause of my look
I might blast off on ya ass and write another book
It took too many times in the cage
Now I'm on the front page looking at myself
I'm on the run
Never to be seen by the eyes
A fugitive
Plus I got a life to live
State by state
Is this just a dream?
Sometimes it seems like it just a figure standing in the mirror from the back
That's why I'm swinging my axe
Everytime so I won't miss I can be hit
Cause I'm touchable
That's my state of mind
Cause I know one day you gotta go in a life of crime
Either the pen or a one way ticket
So I'm asking "what will it be"?
"Where do I solve"?
Nobody knows but me see
When I was a youth used to think I was bulletproof
Never thought I could be hit
Ready to stand my turf
Niggaz can't understand how it work
What's the plan?
We killing our own people for this bullshit
Scared straight wanna escape theres one way outta this crooked county
with a bounty
Coming to get me
Then i'd be on the run
Hoping to find a better day without loaded guns in my face
I'm not the criminal
Fuck your probation
What's my occupation? Selling my dubbs on the street
Cause I gotta eat
Hold on

[Khujo]
Am I awake or is this just another dream?
I pinch myself invisible bars cover my cage
Done lost all conception of time
Trapped in my own mind
Unaware of the world in front or behind
Be trying
To catch up with myself
Evil doers steady working
Guest be leaching off of my wealth
Can't wait for my death
But got me fucked up
Aint man enough
Nigga you got false nuts
Bouncing like rubber balls off the walls
The life we supposed to be living y'all
Them crackers got boxed up
We ain't even the middle men
But..yet... free my mind of confusion
Jehovah witnesses waking me up out my slumber
Using white rice and ??
Stomach aching be still hunger for the taking at the bottom of my barrel
Fuck ass! and being nice ain't got me nathan
But a frown
Too high to get down
Hold on nigga

[Cee-Lo]
You don't know me
And I ain't tryna claim I be knowing you
But I do understand what you going through
Seems like you running outta time
In and out of crime
And everybody ain't gon be able to rhyme..damn!
It must be hard to hold on when your faith is gone
Mmmm...tryna make it all alone
Sometimes you gotta swallow your pride and let the lord decide
You can't hide from the truth I know we've all tried
And I agree its hard to believe in what you can't see
"Well, shit nigga what you keep telling me to hold on for? I'm stuck in
the ghetto wit no where to go, I gotta slang that blow"
"You call yourself tryna teach, seems like I'm outta reach
cause I don't wanna hear another speech
this is all I know how to get up get out and get...
...so fuck that shit!!

[Chorus]
Hold on, be strong, it ain't gon be that long
them folks won't do you wrong
the name of the song is hold on, be strong
it ain't gon be that long
them folks won't do you wrong
the name of the song is hold on, is hold on






Ey, now I'm chiln in the lounge and dis girl gon walk in the bathroom/she

It's Friday afternoon
I'm gon' be off work soon
Then we can get the weekend started

Sittin' 'round will get you nowhere
Don't get it twisted

Start up the band, yeah
Ballin' with my friends, yeah

Gon' take the wheel
Cause I'm already sayin'

Chorus: Chiko Dateh
I'm feelin' faded
And I'm feelin' X-rated
Who wants to chill with me tonight
We rollin' on dubs
With Southern Comfort fitted up
We mix it up with Khool-Aid
Cause this is how we roll

(Verse 2)
Now it's twelve o'clock
Your bitch headin' at the club
But Southern Comfort's creepin' up
You know it's on
We surrounded by five ladies
Who know how to work it, baby
Everybody got it goin' on
With the bumpin' and a grindin'
Indy cruisin' down on Sunset
In the Navy limo
Go over, drinks on me, a round of
Adios, mother[{*fucker*}]
Yellin' at them hoodrats out the window (Hey yo, what's up girl?)
Hey yo, Hypes, stay on the wheel
Cause I'm hangin' out the roofs saying

Repeat Chorus

[Bad Boy]     Yeah

[Bad Boy]     Let's pick her up, home
[Chiko Dateh] I ain't ready to go home yet
[Bad Boy]     Watch the game

[Rap Verse: Bad Boy {Chiko Dateh in background}]
Well, what's up ma, would you just jump on in
We'll ride til the sun sets in
With my nigga
Chiko (That's right)
Ridin' in a limo
Mama wanna drink, so (Uh)
Well, come on, girl
Go and grab your cup
Before I get to wrap you up
You wanna take a bath or what
But stop, I'm prepared for ya
And let a nigga slap a butt (I'm tempted)
I know you see the limo's rented
With everything I said, I meant it
The twilla gon' be highly scented
And hope you see my bad intentions
Keep me if you love the tension (Now listen)
And observe the lesson
My game is like a box of presents
My life is not my first impression
My look is what has got you pressin'
That's why I (???) out my senses {This is how we...}

Bridge: Chiko Dateh
We gon' keep this rollin'
Til six in the mornin'
We ain't playin', this ain't no game
Just ask my dawgs

You can holla at Dubb
Holla at Fingazz

Chorus: Coyote
You all know how we ridin'
We came to make you move
Fuck with all to prove
No matter what hood you reside in
This is how we do, man
We got a new plan
You all know how we ridin'
We came to make you move
Fuck with all to prove
No matter what hood you reside in

[Coyote]
Coyote from the Golden State
Get it straight

(Verse 1)
Let me break it down
I represent my town
Coyote's in the house, put it down, how we get down
G's in the mix, homies, homies, look around
Downtown, brown town, put it down for the brown
Shoop, shoop, shooter, cruise
Pocos Pero Locos
5150
Crazy on the vocals
Lowride, homie, west coast to the east coast
You know how we do, Latin peeps on the move
How to have a piece, so we had to make a move
And it's all good, yeah, from our hood to your hood
Up, blowin' up, like we knew we would, yeah
Holla at your boy, make ya say, "God damn!"
Man, oh man, big things, that's the plan
What's up with these eses, homies on, be checkin'
Til the wheels fall off, holmes
Jura, jura, pusha
Trucha
Locos en carusha

Repeat Chorus

[Lucky Luciano]
Dirty dirt
Hold up
Hun

(Verse 2)
Let me show ya how I do, sittin' on 22's
I'm passin' by the schools, with my music on Screw
Cuffed here to the rim, I'm a show my gold grin
Baby, have you ever seen a candy red Benz?
Tippin' on Swangers
Four cliffhanger
Arm out the window, flashlight on my finger
Pinky ring sunny, I smell like money
Listen to the front row, screaming "I'm Lucky
Luciano, playa made vato"
Can't keep it on the shelf, when my tape hit the store
Got the H-Town gang, nothin' less than the best
How I walk, how I talk, how I dress with finesse
2006, poppin' bottles of Cris
Pour it out on the floor, cause I'm ballin' in the mix
I'm a send my bitch, have her slide down the pole
Tell her count the money out, when I pull up at the door

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 3)
[Ark]
Some are Pocos Pero Locos, leave the vatos actin' babo
Keep y'all niggas on your toes like some tacos, kinda flaco
Little skinny, bet a plenty, if I had a penny for the many
Niggas actin' petty, y'all already be rich
In the doors, see y'all flippin' the flow, Ark kick the shit
Left like a flick of the stove
Listen
I name what the game is and bet I ain't with you
You can find me in the Range, lane switchin'

[Psalmz]
It's not where you from, it's where you stand
One wave of the hand
Might give me 25 in the can
Search
And you find, I put work in my lines, while your radio
Pumps out nursery rhymes
I write life
For my pania, tryin' to feed my bilega
Cause me being broke, eso no combina
Gonna bring rap back
Before I'm gone
Wherever I lay my hat
Well, that's my home

[IzReal]
It's T-Weaponz, the New York Rican east coast thugs
Where we still get Chicano, Latino love
Ya tu sabe, without you, there be no us
No name in lights on Vegas, casino buzz
And we rep for the black and Latino slums (Fa' sho)
New York o L.A., you still see those guns
They be angry
Cause they know that he's all buzz
He's alright, but he's no us

Song:   Hush the Crowd
Typed by: nelly@itis.com

Verse 1:
MC's out there how deep does the underground get?
Deep engough to set up the upset
With your dream and aspirations personal status across the nation
That only leads to the aggravation of realizing thee exaggerate
The stakes when your the best on the block 
You got the whole world locked
Thinkin' lyrics get you over leave you sadly mistaken
When lyricist are brought to the rude awakening
That just cause your flavor is phat 
Doesn't mean your Tasters Choice 
If the crowd doesn't recognize your voice
So new jacks feel the sad truth the proof
Now you can have the best beat and the illest flow
A dope crew with the full proof stage show
But it your jams what the followers don't know
You ain't gettin' no love from the crowd bro
Is that justice when you come correct like a-yo bust this
And heads be like "Who the fuck is this" -B.I.G.-Warning
But when the same records on the play list
The last shall be first and the least likely to get dissed
Now it might of been a while but ain't a damn thing changed
From the opening acts to the solid gold wax
But these are the facts when you gotta wait your turn on line
So let me show you one way to kill time

Hook:
Cause this is for the heads that' on some next shit
(NEXT SHIT) Noboy reocognize till the next hit (NEXT HIT)
You gotta hush the crowd (HUSH THE CROWD) 
I said hush the crowd (HUSH THE CROWD)
A-yo this is for the heads that's on some next shit
(NEXT SHIT) But nobody recognize till it's the next hit (NEXT HIT)
You gotta hush the crowd (HUSH THE CROWD) 
It don't matter when they ain't gettin' loud (HUSH THE CROWD)

Verse 2:
A-yo how many times have you seen it?
The local boy makes good around your hood 
With the style you couldn't knock uless you tried it
But gettin' props is a whole nother mission
Because crowd participation is bore of attrition
See time is the person that you have to sift through 
Cause you just an act people have to sit through
Before the show stoppers pay twice as much as you
But frankly guess who the crowd came to see
Especially the ones who showed up two hours early
Just to pack up the front put yourself in they shoes
We ain't got time for new jacks trying to pay dues
You lose because I got the dialect blues
You're unknown just like them 50,000 other crews
So I'm a either play the back or you can hear the boos
So when you wondering why it's so quiet you hearin' crickets
I'm saving my energy for the names on the ticket
Matter of fact a-yo you best to shorten up your show
I paid my doe to see the pros flow
My man in the back got plenty of pennys to throw
And now you askin' me to say "ho" oh hell no but that's why

Hook

Verse 3:
So let's see as we break this down logically we confirm premiscy 
The crowd wants to murder ya because they never heard of ya
But do you quit it wishing you never would of did it
Or say committed and come with it
Well I prefer the latter cause time fly and if your dope 
You get a deal and watch your pockets get fatter
And if your wack you'll probably get a deal anyways
Cause now a days come on look around it don't matter
Besides what's your options put you hard work up for adoption
And climb back down from the middle of the ladder
I rather break the mics and the lights and lick a shot up in the air
Just to watch the crowd scatter
But naw cause then you mess it up for the few true 
Hardcore heads to give credit where the credit is due
Guarentee that if you keep it dedicated to them
They'll turn around and dedicate it you like yo

[Chorus] [Artillery] (Germ)
You don't wanna be no hussler, sometimes husslers starve
Gettin' money, we pray that we don't touch you god
(You don't wanna no gangsta, sometimes gangstas bleed)
(And one day you face the day when you're forced to squeeze)
See a nigga turn hussler, (then a hussler turn thug)
A thug turn gangsta when he bust his first slug
(When shit hit the fan) tell me who you gonna trust?
(Just do what you gotta do) do what you must

[Artillery]
When you lust the color of green
Schemes with the toast, keep presidental ( ? ) thugs on both knees
Deep in the game and now you're lovin' the coke
Cause it make you wanna stack a quater mill and be ghost
Then get out the ghetto, get out the slums, get out the gutter
Wake up the metal, break up dunns, break up the butter
makin' 'em stutter, mask up, lookin' for green
Would you call a ( ? ), reach for your dreams
Life is losin', everything is never what it seems
Searchin' for the fiends, it's like a maze to get you the green
Send up the wheel like wild crews, spinnin' the wheel
But lay low and spray high like a raw street deal
Truth of the pen, half these cat ain't usin' thier brain
Bustin for nothin', takin' this struggle and vain
And thier's those who respect, and lovin' this game
Play by code and honor when they dealin' with things

[Chorus]

[Germ]
My team is like the Armada comin' through, like a fleet of ships
Guns with clips, it's a color-line between the bloods and crips
Don't avoid the war-zone to save your Private Ryan
Peep around the walls and your top get blown, right if you're afraid of dyin'
Would you froze in a crusial monument
When your peeps needed the ammo the gun down your opponents
Son got slugs in his chest, while your sittin' on the stairs shedin' tears
Actin' like you not knowin', the enemies passed you
You woulden't bust you gun, standin' there lookin' shooked and stunned
Now you're stressin'
Knowin' that the shorty took your man the the essence
When the shit'll bring you, you and the peeps start to restin'
Understand, death will keep pressin'
Can't be dealin' with these cats in the game, we'll floss
Understandin' that thier hands don't be smellin' like yours
Be the same ones, you have with you when you flossin' on tour
Be the main ones, to send thier goons to kick in your door
So you watch who you have with when you're in media circles
Cause in the end, those the ones that gon' hurt you
And the end, those the ones that gon' hurt you

[Chorus]

[Artillery]
If you got dreams to settle down with a brick
Then you better got it on ( ? ) clips
Get you a Tre-8 a three-pound and watch your chips
Better then a dog and you ain't gotta feed 'em shit
Don't trust no man, never gonna talk to no chick
Same bitches set you up and now they shot in you whip
Don't get 'em, all or nothin', you can't even be miss
The streets ain't a play-ground, squeeze the fifth

[Germ]
I'm in cut like ?Porac-Side?, bubbelin'
Godfellas comin' in, we troublin'
You scarred to let us come out, knowin' we dumb out
When we pull them guns out, you change your whole route
Know what Germ be about, spittin' sixteens, spit the last fuckin' eight
To set the record straight
Controllin' my destiny, I'm kind of scarred to fade
If you cross the wrong path, you get your face ate

I be on my job, let me in the door
Something like a thug, but an entrepreneur
Might not see tomorrow, so I gotta get it
I kill all my competition, call the paramedics
I need that paper, put it in my hand, don't be confused
And if you keep it real with me then I keep it real with you
I keep that rap going every minute sorry but I gotta get it
50 on that, give me all that, give me alright
Better not talk back

[Chorus]
Cause I work hard just so I can play hard
But if you work a lil' harder you can play even harder
So I be on my hustle hard hustle hard hustle hard
Oh my God [x2]

Slow money don't make no money, so keep that over there
Mamma ain't raise a dummy, cause I'm a thoroughbred
Benjamin benjamin, think I might need some ritalin
And I need the 3 star cause I be working with Timbaland
Bout that dollar bill, gotta count a mill
But if it don't make dollars chill, or close the deal
Keep that client over every minute sorry but I gotta get it
50 on that, give me all that, give me alright
Better not talk back

Cause I work hard just so I can play hard
But if you work a lil' harder you can play even harder
So I be on my hustle hard hustle hard hustle hard

Typed by: Dy_face@Hotmail.Com

[Intro]
[Girl]         Mr. Mike, can you give some money to get my hair done?
[Mr. Mike] What's wrong with your hair right now?
[Girl]        Well, you know I get it done every week, and I need my nails done too
[Mr. Mike] Look, I'ma tell you like this

[Verse 1: Mr. Mike]
I ain't the one, the one to get played like a pooh butt
See, I'm from the street, so I know what's up
On these silly games that's played by the women
I'm only happy when I'm goin' up in them
Yo, but you know, I ain't no GIMMIE THIS society
But girls in biker shorts are so fly to me
So I step to them, with aggression
Listen to the kid, and learn a lesson today
See, they think we narrow minded
Cause they got a cute face, and big-behinded
So I walk over and say: How you're doin?
See, I'm only want some lootin'
But you know, ugh, you gots to play it off cool
Cause if they catch you slippin, yo, you'll get schooled
And they'll get you for your money, son
Next thing you know, you're gettin their hair and they nails done
Fool, and they'll let you show them off
But when it comes to sex and gettin' wet, they got a bad cough
Or a headache, it's all give and no take
Run out of money, you look dummy, and watch your heart break
They'll drop you like a bad habit
But a nigga with money, yo, you gotta have it
Fuckin' with me though, they gets none
You can't juice Mr. Mike baby girl, cause I ain't the one

[Chorus: Mr. Mike]
I ain't the one, I'm livin' life on the run
We might not have fun baby but what's done is done
I ain't the one, maybe in due time you'll see
That this thing with you and me, just wasn't meant to be
I ain't the one, too busy livin' life on the run
You might not have fun honey, but what's done is done
I ain't the one, maybe in due time you'll see
That this thing with you and me, just wasn't meant to be

[Verse 2: Mr. Mike]
Yo, sometimes I used to wonder
How the fuck an ugly nigga get a fine bitch's number?!
He's gettin juiced for his ducats
I tell a girl in a minute, yo, I drive a bucket
And won't think nothin' of it
She can ride or walk, either leave it or love it
I show her that I'm not the O-the-N-E
Say: I'm a straight up N-I double-G A
Cause I'm gamin' on a female that's gamin' on me
You know, I spell girl with a B
A brother like me is only out for one thing
I think with a stackin' cream
But I won't bring no flowers to her doorstep when we goin' out
Ha, cause you'll take it for granted, I guess, no doubt
And after the date, I'ma want to do the wild thing
You want lobster huh?  I'm thinkin' Chicken wing
And when I take you, you'll get frustrated
You can't juice Mr. Mike girl and you hate it
But you see, I don't go nuts
No, over girls like you with the big old butts
It start comin' out the pocket, to knock it
Cause when the damage is done
Ugh, you can only pay me girl, you can't play me girl
For the simple fact that, I ain't the one

[Chorus: Mr. Mike w/ Variations]
I ain't the one, I'm livin' life on the run
We might not have fun hon' but what's done is done
I ain't the one, maybe in due time you'll see
That this thing with you and me, just wasn't meant to be
I ain't the one, too busy livin' life on the run
You might not have fun baby, but what's done is done
I ain't the one, maybe in due time you'll see
That this thing with you and me, just wasn't meant to be

[Girl] Can I have some money, pleeeease?

[Verse 3: Mr. Mike]
Give you money while I bother
Cause you know, I'm lookin' nothin' like your father
Girl, I can't be played or ganked
Uh uh, ganked means gettin' took for your bank
Or your gold, or your money, or somethin'
Nine times out of ten, bitches givin' up nothin'
They just mad when I put it in perspective
But let's see, if my knowledge is effective
To the brothers man, they robbin' you blind
Cause they fine with a big behind, but pay it no mind
Keep your money to yourself homie
And if you got enough game
You'll get her name and her number
Without going under
You can't leave them, and love and stay above them
I used to get no play, now she's stayin' mentions this
Cause I heard I had a mansion in Texas
But I lied and played the one
Just to get some now she feels dumb
To my niggaz it's funny
Ugh, but that's what you get tryin' to play my boy's money
Now, don't you feel used?
But I don't give hoot, huh, because I knock boots
You shouldn't be, so damn material
And try to milk Mr. Mike like cereal
How many times do I have to say it?
Cause if I have to go get a gun, I'ma spray it
You girls will learn, uhh, I don't burn
You think I'm a sucker, what?, but I ain't the one

[Chorus: Mr. Mike w/ Variations]
I ain't the one, I'm livin' life on the run
We might not have fun baby but what's done is done
I ain't the one, maybe in due time you'll see
That this thing with you and me, just wasn't meant to be
I ain't the one, baby, I'm livin' life on the run
You might not have fun sugar, but what's done is done
I ain't the one, maybe in due time you'll see
That this thing with you and me, just wasn't meant to be

[Outro: Mr. Mike]
I ain't the one, nigga

We popping bottles of the pink shit, take 'em to the dome
We ain't ever on that weak shit, all we blow is strong
Every day we party til early in the morn
Put that shit on Instagram so they know I'm putting on
I know you see me... (yeah, yeah)
Yeah, I be puttin' on... (I be puttin' on, there's no way that you wouldn't know)
I know you see me... (Stop and pose for the picture)
Yeah, I be puttin' on...

[Wale]
Yeah, Double M, Genius to be exact...
I know you see me with your looking ass, what the fuck you looking at?
This is MMG and we don't speak to all you fucking crabs
Got a bunch of cash, but money is under, fam
I'd rather be over-prepared than slip in here understaffed
Did you understand I'm down to ride with my niggas
Just a double M, you can't fuck with them unless you're certified to ride with us
Keep the broads far up out my business and my mind following the ditches
And I ain't tripping off of potential -- that's another word for "ain't did shit"
Haha, work, and I put D.C. on
we ain't been this high since the E.R
See y'all niggas be some peons, talking about y'all be gone
Whole time niggas wouldn't swing, playing tee-ball

[Chorus]

[Wiz Khalifa]
I know you see exactly what the fuck a nigga like me doin'
{*laughing*} Uhh.. it's hard not to see that shit man
Clear the motherfuckin' smoke, it's loud enough
Uh, haha...

Hundred thousands, hundred thousands, I be throwing hundred thousands
I know why they trusting me -- cause I got all these funds around 'em
My fan base consist of niggas with drugs around 'em
Educated sisters to bitches dancing with ones around 'em
I know you think all we do is have fun around here
But I'm from a city where young niggas carry guns
Don't single out any corner -- its popping on every one
They talking bout what they gon do, its probably already done
I'm running through cake, running through states
Take your one to the face every one or two cakes
Just bought a new crib, that's a wonderful space
Ask me how I feel I got it so my nigga

[Chorus]

[French Montana]
Whattup Wiz? Roscoe whattup?
Rosay, whattup big bro? HAAAAH~!
I know you see me...
Ha-haaaaaa...
I know you see me.. haaah
Puttin' on, Putin' on, puttin' on
Ay, ay, ay...

I be cooler than a motherfucker, wanna hit the fans
Selling work on the Internet -- call it Instagram
And you know I do it for my city, you know I'm putting on
Hundred racks on this clothes a nigga putting on
Self made, self paid, forty on my belt waist
Hundred round lobster feast, get a shell face
I be twisted off of molly doe, chopped bricks karate doe
Closet two floors -- safari doe
Brown bag paper tag, nigga can't pay for swag
We know we love the game but we hate to brag, Montana
Me and Rozay twisted on a boat
Watching all you fuck niggas choke, Coke Boy

Gonna show you what it feels like (lets fly)

Hey baby, come and love me
Ooo child you, you make me crazy
I need you, right here next to me
We're gonna go away while we're still at home

Well I came at you a young boy, girl
With no experience.
Year in year out
We had our ups and downs
But I always took it serious.

I made a joke
I played the fool
I took time, made all the plans.
I know I told you that we were
Supposed to have something
Made for this weekend
But I changed my mind.

	<CHORUS>
I changed my mind.
I changed my mind
I changed my mind
And I changed my mind
	<END CHORUS>

Well it started getting cozy, girl
I let you control the reins.
And despite what I knew to be true
I'd hoped that things would change.

I'd even say I can't completely blame
But I even take 'cause was situations in
Retrospect with the things you say
Would shift direction when put into action.

But I just let it whiz on by.
People say "L-B it's goin awry!"
And I'd flip up say "that's not right."
Now I see my shit's not tight.
Now I changed my mind

CHORUS

Well lookin back now
I was a young man, girl.
In hindsight I regret.
I never listen to my better judgement
So my blind side got the best of me.

But we live and learn.
What you did in turn
Made me never have to settle for less.
And would I deserve and once you mature girl
You'll always be second best.

CHORUS

I'd even say I can't completely blame
But I even take 'cause was situations in
Retrospect with the things you say
Would shift direction when put into action.

But I just let it whiz on by.
People say "L-B it's goin awry!"
And I'd flip up say "that's not right."
Now I see my shit's not tight.

It really pains me to say things change
But your limitations would've held me back.
The things you say try to underrate me
They were just a reflection of your self-respect.

But now I let it whiz on by.
You can't tell me LB can't fly!
Kiss my wings, you can't hypnotize me!
Hear the M-singer singin this bye-bye.
I changed my mind bout this here relationship
That you've become so complacent with.

I've changed my mind.
You've sacrificed everything we had
For a happenin' price.
Changed my mind, plain and simple
Now tame and gentle
Changed my mind, i tried
I kept it quiet now why the hell
Ya wanna go and advertise?

[Hook 2x]
It wasn't for this, it wasn't for that
Ohh, best believe a better world

[Talib Kweli--talking over chorus]
Yes, ladies and gentleman
You do have Kenn Starr in the house, Asheru
Talib Kweli...

[Kenn Starr]
If it wasn't for the way that we live
Too many single mothers raisin' our kids
Too many brothers caged in the Pen
Engagin' a bid, enslaved by the pigs
If it wasn't for crooked cops that pop shots grazin' our wig
That sends slugs reckless, plus these thugs with a death wish
That take your life for the ice that flood in your necklace
The blood of the helpless and innocent (and innocent)
If it wasn't for so-called friends that turned Benedict
Snakes in the grass and crabs in the lake
Cuz I'm black and its late, getting' harassed by the Jake
Blasted with eight times five, plus one
Lethal deposit, reach for your wallet, they bust guns
That's why I trust none and I keep to myself
I can't blame cats that pack heat in they belt
And quick to clap, never givin' in
If it wasn't for this and that
It'd be a better world that we livin' in

Hook 2x

[Asheru]
If it wasn't for a mic check I wouldn't have a check at all
Nowadays you can't live that way
The markets way too unstable, there's too many pimp labels
Playing rappers like a ho, manhandlin' the dough
Demandin' them to go on a track to bring the loot back
Now you playing for the team and the captain, that's cream
You got the dream to push a mean two-seater
With a diva riding shotgun, just to say you got one
You make the songs, but labels only want the hot ones
Send you back to the drawing board, until you got some
Now I guess we got problems
Even your all-creative mind ain't enough to try and solve 'em
The doors revolvin', younger cats are starvin'
They want it more than you, might go to war with you
To reap the heap of dough that's at the end of the rainbow
You can't be mad, man, that's how the game go

Hook 2x

[Talib Kweli] (talking)
(yeah, c'mon!)
(yea, here we go, yeah!)
I'm about to show you what this black power is
Red, black, and green on the wrist how I live
In the cold world where we bust off the black llamas
Every winter where we lose more son to black mommas
If hip-hop got seasons, right now its spring
Like when everybody selling death, "kiss the ring" (yeah!)
You know how it goes, people change color like autumn
Kids learn through experience, fuck what a teacher taught 'em
Puff a relief for boredom; rough will release a quarter
And the parents who paid enough attention to at least ignore 'em
Blowing up mics, throwin' up signs
To help niggaz you confusin' it with cryin'
The winners write the history books
Mystery looks past prisoners of war, that's what my listeners are for
Turn the tide on this fuckery, ride on this fuckery
You shoulda never let me in the industry, you're stuck with me

For the streets, y'all
Bang it in the clubs, y'all

[ VERSE 1: Skoob ]
Aiyo, I kiggedy-came back cause my fans was callin
My Lower East Side boriquas to Spanish Harlem
My squad is sick, giggedy-got a squad of chicks
That'll rob a chick (for what) for her Prada shit
In the hood crackfiends keep my Ordo clean
I'll turn a room full of dykes to a porno scene
Henny and Coke, nah, higgedy-Henny and smoke
I don't love her, throw a rubber on the jimmy and stroke
My game tight like Dreamcast
Half these niggas never seen cash
Half my street team tryin clean cash
I play the hood in a tinted down dark somethin
We finish it, now who the fuck want start somethin?
You fuckin with the unfuckable, untouchable
Get this cash, what's my last name? A Huxtable
Fuck a Rolls, give me a 5 and I'm good
This ain't a sit-com, my dogs tryin to survive in the hood

[ CHORUS ]
Yo yo, all my honeys, if you love hip-hop
Get money if you love hip-hop
Yeah, show your titties if you love hip-hop
(Cause we them bitches, what?)
Yo yo, all my dogs, if you love hip-hop
Yeah, make money if you love hip-hop
Grab your dick if you love hip-hop
Cause we them niggas

[ VERSE 2: Dray ]
You miggedy-might know the kid, I'm from around the way
I stay on the go and smoke a pound a day
It's Dray, I lock it down like it 'posed to be
And ain't niggedy-none of y'all comin close to me
I run through, 1-2, criggedy-crush the scene
Now look, all the chicks riggedy-rush the team
To get it on with the mack, on in the back
Hit the studio and get it on with the track
Then I run around like I own the town
Own the crown, yo Boogie Bang, hold me down
See, I'm from the streets where the hustlers play
Police come through and we ain't got nothin to say
From Jersey, dunn, piggedy-pack a dirty gun
Underneath the miggedy-Marbury jersey, dunn
It's one for all, bust rhymes, guns and all
It's Diggy-Das, no doubt, we the ones to call

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 3: Skoob ]
Yo yo, you know how I get when I'm in the club
I'm linin up every dime in the club and tryin to get love
I'm buyin em bub' at the bar unfoldin my stack
Committed hoodrat holdin my gat
She only speak through the hole in my gat
Put a hole in your face, try and run, she put a hole in your back
Either or, it don't matter, liggedy-lemonhead chickenhead
She leave a nigga dead, BK to ??????
[ Dray ]
I give her bread but she better bring the change back (don't play)
I'm from the hood and ain't never gonna change that (no way)
You know my steez, blow my trees
I riggedy-rep that shit cause I know mamis
That don't play, spend cash and ball
And piggedy-puff hydro and blaze hash and all
I like my drinks strong, my cigar Cuban
Biggedy-by now you know how the god's groovin
Come on

Typed by: Cno Evil

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
And they think they know you
Til one day they show you
So no matter what they say
I go hard
And they think it's over
But it's never over
Cuz soon as you think I'm down
I go hard

[Wiz Khalifa]
You done benched that bitch card
Been here before
But don't ever let them see you
On the ground
Dues what you gotta pay
And people see you gotta say
So don't ever let them see you
On the ground

[Chorus]

[Ghostface Killah]
Yeah, yo, aiyo, dangerous thoughts, mind of a militia
Bottles of the 150th, poured over twisters
Broken bones, The Pillage, Staten Island's the illest
The biggest land fillers, we creep like caterpillars
Love raising, dirty guns with a few bodies
Teach niggas how to walk again, from the fucking shotty
Sixth sense, six pack, six degrees of separation
My evil third eye blinks with no hesitation
Dust bags, spoonfuls, the sugar help the medi'
Go down smooth and steady, blowing the green deadly
Hang weed pops, isolator of hash bricks
Needle left stuck in his arm, died of a bad fix
We still rock, still dry drawers on the stove
Got bread from back in the day, it's growing some more
2Pac's back, my glock's fat
After the gun smoke, you screaming "Where my block at?"

[Chorus]

[Boy Jones]
I go hard like Listerine on bacteria
Hulk's so hard, he got the power to Avenge ya
I go hard, herbal tea, kidney cleanser
I go hard, L.A., Dwight Howard
Hoods pounding hard, too much smoke in the chimney
Fire plus iron evaporates the enemy
Jason Statham, Mechanic, all mechanically
Right about now, I can really use some Hennessey
I go hard like you never thought I could
One swing with the hammer, the nail's in the wood
My Iron Fist is so ridiculous
Forever continuous, venomous and dangerous

Song:   I Go Through So Much
Typed by: Lil Hustle

[Hook]
I go through so much, so I try to stay fucked up
Because, when I'm sober I can't maintain
Even though I do my best, the only thing I earn is stress
So I, spend most of my days chilling with Mary Jane

[Z-Ro]
Lately I've been going through more bullshit, than a bull fighter
So when I sing my praises to God, one verse is like a full choir
My every thought is pain, strain is stressing me to death
Everyday is like a rehearsal, that's prepping me for death
I think I'm ready, because this world ain't no friend of mine
Only thing I qualify fo', is murder and Penitentiary time
Y'all should of shot me in the jimmy, instead
But I guess they was feeling eachother, and get head in the bed
Here I am, first born torn between heaven and hell
I tell my people say no to dope, but I let it sell
Need to practice my preaching, calling the kettle black
I know I'm a Pac before or not, I gotta peddle crack
Ain't nobody got my back except the laws, when they on it
So I be going for broke, demolishing my opponents
Leaving no traces, just blood on faces believe that
HK I'ma squeeze that, you won't even wan' be back

[Hook]

[Z-Ro]
I can't focus I'm losing my mind, real fast
Dreaming and fiending for the day, I can make some real cash
Dropping album after album, platinum song after song
But it's like I ain't did nothing, cause the lights ain't on
How can I win, it's like everything I do is a motherfucking sin
It got a nigga fiending, to see my end
All of my friends are fake, they come around when I'm spending cash
But when I'm broke they out the do', with wheels spinning fast
Lonely, daily dodging the devil but he on me
Telling my people fuck him, cause he be working through my homies
Burning bridges, and I don't give a fuck
Remember y'all laughing at me, when I couldn't get a buck
It's all gravy baby, I got bigger hurdles I'm trying to jump over my residence
And my fear, gon be something I dump over
And it might not be much, but it's all I got
So when I paint it, promethazyne is all I pop

[Hook]

[Z-Ro]
I trust nobody even best friends, be digging your grave
Niggaz go on lock, when they come out wifey giving them AIDS
I don't give a fuck what anybody think, about me
When I was breaking my back for em, they didn't think about me
Got hot at a nigga, but they know that I'm raw
Too nervous to face a madman, so they go and shoot up my car
I got too many niggaz, trying to take me off of my game
And every woman I be feeling, be fucking with my brain
Now that I'm gone, I love you mean I'm leaving you soon
Plus I don't feel the way I did, at first I need me some room
Too familiar with heart ache and pain, it don't hurt no mo'
Just homesick, I don't wanna be on this earth no mo'
Flirt with my chrome 4-4, cause she believe what I say
She ain't gon ask me no questions, she just gon leave em to lay
And leaving no traces, just blood on faces she down with it
Stay rolling around with me, when I'm down she down with me

"Doo-doo"
"Doo-doo" --> Frank Stallone

[A.L.T.]
(Verse 1)
I take you back
In my past, I used to live life fast
And yo
It wasn't shit to let the .38 blast
I had it goin'
On, with the bitches and hoes, too
Yo, come to think about it, so did my whole crew
We bumped the old school jams from the East Coast
We was the baddest Mexicans outta East Los
Back in the days, many crews got hushed
It seems
Every night, me and my homies got
Rushed
But
We never back down, even if we got beat down
We came back next week to the same town
And we was ready for 'em
But they still figure
That they could do us
So tiny pulled a steel trigger
I had a .38 special, not a A.K.
As we sped away, Tony G. was on KDAY

Refrain: A.L.T.
Mama told me, "Yo, Al, you better change your ways"
And I'm a take you way back in the days
And I'm a take you back

Break: Tony G. {A.L.T.}
"Take you back"
"Doo-doo, doo, doo"
"Take you back"
"Doo-doo, doo, doo" {And I'm a take you back}
"Take you back"
"Doo-doo, doo, doo"
"Take you back"
"Doo-doo, doo, doo" --> Frank Stallone ("Way back")

(Verse 2)
Back in '83, we hit the party like fifteen deep
I kept the chrome in my jacket so nobody'll creep
Way back when
Bitch's hair was fifteen feet
And the homies had the stray cat strut look
Now I'm a
Open up the book to another page
And how I rock a house party with no fuckin' stage
Crack the 40 and it's on
Yo
Tilt the 40 and it's gone
But
My homie Tiny O. has had my back
And a fuckin' pitbull that was trained to attack
Now
Put the system in the backyard (yo)
And when the cops come, act hard
Now
The powers on, and the jams come
{*sample jam*}

Repeat Refrain

Repeat Break Twice

(Verse 3)
Me and my primo, we was rollin' drop
And we was dodgin' the cops, cause we was lookin' for the crew
Spot
Rollin' in a six-deuce
I'm a target cause Mexicans never had a gang
Truce
Hit the spot, and it's dark
My primo said, "Park!"
Then we bailed out a '62 Skylog
Yeah
This vato rolled up
"Where you from, holmes?"
I dropped my 40
But Blanco said, "Stop, holmes"
I took two steps back
I could tell he was packed
But the skinny motherfucker's on crack
I turned
And dashed nine blocks
I heard nine shots
Now my primo's in a pine box
And if I go back and get him
I know
I can get him, squeeze the trigger on the nine
I hit 'em
And as I reminisce about my life (Mama told me, "Yo, Al, you better change your ways")
It's a wonder I still got my life (And I'm a take you way back in the days)
And I'm a take you back

Repeat Break Twice

[Tony G.]
"Take you back"
"Doo-doo, doo, doo"
"Take you back"
"Doo-doo, doo, doo"
"Take you back"

[A.L.T.]
This shit is dedicated to all the homies we done lost in the past
Go pass me that 40, I'm a crack this shit open
And just chill
The old school shit
And to all you gangstas
A.L.T. just took you back
Way back
Back into time

I'm a playa
I'm a hustler
I'm a gangsta making paper
I'm a rider
I'm a hustler
I'm a playa making paper
I'm a gangsta
I'm a hustler
I'm a playa making paper
I'm a rider
I'm a gangsta
I'm a playa making paper

[Verse 1: Lucky Luciano]
I've been hustling all week, now I'm ready to spend
I walk up in the club about 12 AM
Bitches everywhere, sayin' "There Lucky go"
I'm a big time player, never loving no hoe
Slab in the front, and we ballin' inside
Ballers watch me and my dog pop bottles all night
Y'all get out of line, and I'm pullin' out a nine
They love to see me broke ass stop without my sign
But I'm cold in the game, and you know I'm a star
Doin' the hoes in the frame with ya photo car
If you looking too hard, what you talking to me for?
Boy, I'm 'bout to bread with the money, nothing more
I leave her out the club with the baddest bitches in this
Sqaures fall, black live, burn off my 20 inches
I roll a 'shroom and the chrome pistola
Young Houston, you gone off the damn doja

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 2: Goldtoes]
It's the Goldtoes
Kickin' down doors
In the club, hoes recognize a C-E-O
Man, that's fa' sho
I'm from the 'Sco
Where they get they pimp on
And blowing the hydro
I pull over here in H-Town because of Lucky
In the club, every night
Poppin' bottles of the bubbly
What I'm saying is for certain
All night pervin'
My name is Goldtoes, and the money's what I'm earnin'

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 3: Lucky Luciano]
Yeah, I got a gun
But that ain't really nothin'
With my partner Goldtoes, might stab you in the club
I'm a big bank flipper
Hustle from a nigga
Hand-cuffed ya bitch when a boss playa enter
Lined to get ya, that bitch is on zipper
Have her ass on the track and high heels off the pizzle
Aw, need a mob figure, got richer
I'm foretellin' y'all how I live my life, nigga
I put it down for the players and the hustlers
Broke boys hate me cause I stay away from busters
But I stay throwed til the day that I die
Do it big, spend money, drive drank and get high
Pass by somethin' new with a piston on the floor
Beans, steak and shrimp with my bitches on the poles
Man, it ain't nothin' to a boss named Lucky
Everyday, all day, I'm on a grind to make money

Same old attitude, but I'm on that new shit
They say they gon' rob me, see me neva do shit

No love, cry when only babies die
And when I go that casket, better cost a hundred thou
I pray to God I look my killer in his eyes
Snatch his soul up out his shirt, let's take him for that ride
O.g. is one who standin' on his own feet
A boss is one who guarantee we gone eat
Fuck a blog dawg cause one day we gone meet
I'm a spazz on yo' ass like I'm on E!
Or a double stack, better nigga, double that

Song:   Impressed
Typed by: Byg_Balla

[Tedashii]
ALL RISE, for the coming of the king of the Jews
Sixteen saints salute for Him bringin the truth
Hold up for a minute put your focus on Him
The selah for a second to catch more than a glimpse
Of the one placed higher than the angels in heaven
Pre-eminent so dawg that means He never comes second
Nothing should ever replace or overshadow this God
Ever reduce or lower his position as God
Man, He's holy, plus diving with all splendor
It's time Jesus Christ became your life's true center
The focus of your life so that your life be permanent
Pause
And peep this God that made the world and the firmament
Man, I'll put this on my momma, He'll blow that mind
Watch as I paint the picture for ya, its kodak time
If you ever wondered who He was, then no that now
No interruption take the sweets and heats and throw that down

[Chorus]
How can you hear about this God dawg and not get impressed?
The one that gave the sky its height and the ocean its depth
The one that hung all of the planets plus the moon and the sun
And let you hear this song that you might commune with the Son

[Tedashii]
So tell me what you seeing when you looking at God
Is it Yahweh the indescribable, unspeakable God
Or dawg, is it Elohim, all sovereign and majestic
The provident creator with a six day checklist
Or maybe the King of Kings up on the side of the Father
With nail prints in his hands cuz He decided to bother
Or do you look and see someone who ain't no better than you
Well if you the focus dawg I suggest you better your view
How you gon' act like you compare to Him?
You don't compare to the seraphim that cherish Him
Man, you got two lungs that still need air in them
The bottom line dawg, when you looking at God
You should see the king of glory not a midst or a fog
Not Father Time with the long beard and clock
and not this passive Jesus Walks that you hear in hip hop
But the God of the Bible Isaiah saw in Chapter 6
Who got a glimpse and said "God is Holy, I need to repent"

[Chorus]

[Tedashii]
Man, I've been looking for a minute how we impressed with things
Plus ourself, so we came to address this thing
We came to rep Him so dawg you would bless the King
And be impressed like Froto was with the ring
Like the Phanatik, take time dawg and think on these things
Think about how you're a sinner and you need to be clean
We sons of Adam fallen sinners and deserve to be killed
Man, we couldn't keep the standard cuz perfection His will
He is coming back for all of the cats
That allowed Christ to be they ransom and satisfy God's wrath
But, we'd rather think the bible's all about us
Instead of Jesus whom God said put all of your trust
Man stop coming up to God cuz you think He'll bless ya
Man stop coming up to God cuz you want something extra
Its time he impressed ya, and not because of all that He's done
But because of who He is dawg the Glorious One

As I begin to unleash leavin' rappers deceased
From the fece as I react like a beast and never cease
Cause niggas be basin' they don't know what they facin'
I'm strong as a mase (whoa) and or shall I say Jason
Cause backbones I rip on the niggas I flip on
The slip I dip then I'm swayze in my whip
Cause I'm a crazy motherfucker when it's time to flip
A track like a bitch you'll get slapped 
Or a nigga you'll get clapped
I catch wreck and flex stap necks come test what's next? 
Some sex no motherfuckers hittin' decks
Cause the man be frontin' on the bacon 
Don't wanna take a scrappin'
From Dip Dab no your gladly mistakin'

Your boots get rocked hops like Rodney King with the cops
So niggas stay neutral I drive you kuku

Cause I'm straight on a mission
Destroying competition got mad ammunition 
Sit back and just listen I got the woo wop the doo wop
The uzi makes the crew drop 
And don't try to run cause the nine will make you stop

On the job like Elliot Ness
Makin' crews call in distress
I rest my case based on how I get bass
And grab the mic lace the space and face and leave 'em all base
Now I doubt that a nigga wanna go all out
I find these fears wipe his tears leave a nigga singin' Shaq
I beez who I am so who you?
And who you lookin' for don't label me hardcore
I rip out the core
Now shackles off your feet cause people wanna dance
(It's your last chance) make the crowd wet they pants
So look son fuckin' with this ML could fuck up your dental
Wreck your mental, leave your crew setimental
Here we lay your style to rest two verses to your chest 
Hurt your brain like bad sex
I guess this is what it comes to, who got the most crew?
True, But I'm true without my crew 
So all y'all motherfuckers make room on my dick
Got the rawchy fuck-you-style like a porno flick
You can't show me don't know me so approach a nigga slowly
I"m the Mic Lord so therfore the microphone is homie
The overlord of rhythm Smakin' niggas like Diggem
So pretend my friend I'm the victor in the end word life 
I get's more stress then strife my tongue is sharp like a knife
Get hype I'll bust your dome like it was right
Goodnight and good eveneng leaving the mic barley breathing
MC's weezin' what the reason? 
Breakin' backs and your knees in it's that season

Typed by: timm2014@hotmail.com

[Chorus]
Yo it's the inner city blues goin' through my headphones
Starin' at space and runnin through the red zone
Feel like rhymin', freestylin'
Going back in the time when brothers wasn't wildin'
But nowadays it's a brand new tactic
Brothers be gettin fly and traveling galactic, uh
Better beam down to earth
I'm blowing up with mine first

[Verse One]
When I was young I used to roll with thugs that sold drugs
Exporting high-caliber weapon transportin'
It was very important to the niggas on the block
That you knew how to get down when it was time to rock
Came like we was raised on a farm
I mean, niggas be on they way to school gettin' clicked on
In '81 
Niggas used to get thrown up in a suplex 
And robbed for their summer youth checks, what
Other stick-up kids lookin' like 'Who's next?'
Runnin' out, knockin' niggas out in two steps 
Or three steps
Deceps ran sprintin'
Everyday was a fight like it was San Quinton
Niggas hidden about who been snitchin' to the dean
At 3 o'clock his wig got split upon the scene
I guess a buck 50 just ain't good enough no more
Kids be playin' tag with the four four mag
Little bad motherfuckas need to stay in school
Shorty I went the same route so I'm droppin the jewel
Mad niggas gettin' killed over nothin'
Straight squeezin' off on motherfuckas
When you hit they nerve button

[Chorus]
Yo it's the inner city blues goin' through my headphones
Starin' at space an' runnin through the red zone
Feel like rhymin', freestylin'
Going back in the time when brothers wasn't wildin'
But nowadays it's a brand new tactic
Brothers be gettin fly and traveling galactic, uh
Better beam down to earth, I'm blowing up with mine first

[Verse Two]
Yo, I heard this chick say she wanted a +Ruffneck+
Niggas tryin ta be ruffnecks but, yo motherfuck that
Tryin' ta act wild and get a nigga killed
Hook him up to the respirator and put him on tilt, word
Bad boys move in silence
Was said bad boys caught two with a silencer to his head, uh
Some niggas lucky enough to do it and live through it
I had a chance but I chose not to pursue it
Most of the rough niggas I know be like dead or locked up
When they come home my niggas look blown
Swollen up, but the times is changed
So ya better get hip and get a grip mad quick nigga
One to three is no joke
Five to ten is even worse
25 years, I'll be cryin' steel tears
Trying to send a bomb letter to the judge
Special delivery nigga, you made a lifetime grudge, uh
I make a shank out a spoon or a light fixture
Stay alert and try to keep out of the mixture
I never smoke cigarettes but I get 'em so I could sell 'em
Here comes static, somebody better tell 'em (what)
My ward gear be like five or six layers
With books tied to me and I'ma 7:30 playa
This ain't the time to be franchise neckin'
The trouble arises quicker than the national deficit

[Chorus]
Yo it's the inner city blues goin' through my headphones
Starin' at space an' runnin through the red zone
Feel like rhymin', freestylin'
Going back in the time when brothers wasn't wildin'
But nowadays it's a brand new tactic
Brothers be gettin fly and traveling galactic, uh
Better beam down to earth, I'm blowing up with mine first

Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

The ?? significance of uhh, the prison moratorium project
throughout hip-hop culture, rap music, gets play
in terms of being able to both be truthtelling
soul-searching as well as witness-bearing
Out here in the garden too much of this suffering and pain out here
but to transfigure that pain and suffering into some joy
so we can cry and have some source for struggle
Serious political.. struggle predicated on broad vision
And that's what we're really after
That's why the prison moratorium project IS, so very important
And umm, that's the big part of it

Typed by: Cno Evil

[Intro: The Reverend William Burk]
We going platinum, Rah, check

[The Reverend William Burk]
Yo, I was on a mission walking down Stoney Island on the way towards Church's Chicken
Front to help myself to a big heaping fix, and about six wings and seven biscuits
When I seen this chick from a better of distance
So I guess the notion to go get the digits, this instance
She was bad too, had a juicy booty and a Chi-Town tattoo
I asked her "what that it do?"
They call me The Reverend and I show I'm impressed with you
Shit, it's like a blessing of you
I seen you from across the street, needed a close up too
Ooh, so I approached with game, such an incredible thing
To see you walk when you off the chain, true
So what I oppose we do, is that we get ourselves something to drink
and something to chew
Then take it back to the crib
I'm already sick, sugar pie baby, where do you live?
She said, she 75th, but her momma in the house doing hair with a bunch of the kids
And wanted her to run up some ribs
I said "You dig on swine?", she said "Nah, that's up in they biz"
Say well this the thing, you need to be with me, you need to be on my team
You looking so fine, it's like I'm having a dream
How's about Kenny's BBQ and Ice Cream?
She said, "Kenny's BBQ and Ice Cream? He got ribs, tips, fish and even chicken wings"
Right, so we can do our thing, go and reach in your purse and give me some green
Go and reach in your purse and give me some green
Go and reach in your purse and give me some green
So we dropped the pork off, then I broke off
Hand on her thigh and the shit was so soft
She rolled up a blunt for something to toke off
I'm in the crib eating, and smoking at no cost
Take, take, take, taking no loss
Say Rev, you a sure nuff boss
I could tell by the gold in your grill
And the game that you spill and the way you so floss

[Chorus 2X: Tash Mahogany]
Baby, you got me, into you
And I'll do anything you want
Baby, you got me, into you
And I'll do anything you want

[Rugged Monk]
Forgive me God, for committing these sins
Fucking these birds and fucking they friends
Serving all night, trying to make these ends
Smoking sherm, sniffing coke, sipping juice and gin
Flipping these hoes off double stacked pills
Til I met my match and I wanted to chill
But a nigga acted ill, posted with an ice grill
Nigga, you bluffing, you know you ain't busting
Say you was, and you know you wasn't
Say you does, and you know you doesn't
Tony the Tiger be fucking his cousin
Hoes I got, yeah, dime a dozen
Have 'em huffin, screaming and cussin'
Put that butter on an English muffin
Bang on that ass like a tight percussion
Bang on that ass like a tight percussion

Song:   In Ya Hood
Typed by: Byg_Balla

[Chorus]
Aww man y'all done messed up and let us in ya hood
To preach the way the truth the life in ya hood
Forget the 'lac with the steering wheel made of wood
It's time we see the truth of Christ in ya hood

[Verse One]
Aww man y'all done messed up and let us in ya hood
To preach the way the truth the life in ya hood
Forget the 'lac with the steering wheel made of wood
It's time we see the truth of Christ in ya hood
I'll never stop what I'm doing
Grooving moving for Jesus
Steady grindin in the streets just to reach all of my peoples
Momma, daddy, sister, brother, uncle, cousin and them
It's time we get it in for Jesus, start a buzz up for him
Man, but somethings always stopping ya, maybe your love for sin
Or the lack of love you showing when you cursing at men
Man how holy is he to you, how impressed by him are you
Is your life a story all about him or dawg does it star you
The answers your actions, the fruit of your passions
Plus the prove of the facts and who it is that you casting
Make a switch, change your role
116 became the mold
The word to the Colossians to know God is in control

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
Hey dawg its T-dot, coming from the street block
Just to rep the chief rock, cause I think that he's not
In the place where he's got the chief spot
In ya life like the top
Cause life is all headed for the end like the sign that reads stop
It's ashes to ashes and dust to dust
You breathe in breathe out, then its back to the dirt
The fact of the earth is life is nothing more than vain glory
Your born, you suffer, you die, it's the same story
So come on dawg get closer to the life of this teacher
The preacher, savior, creator, our lord, king, and our leader
Of this holy culture movement, man we might insult when
You hear that to make it in you gotta go through him
Your a sinner, he's the Savior, your created, He's creator
But no matter how you spin it, you gone have to meet the maker

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
It goes love, joy, hope and peace
My motivation for the ministry while hitting the streets
Man, we aliens, souled out on a mission fishing for heathens
Representing the kingdom, I'm praying that this truth can reach them
Like a telegram message that was sent through the wire
Or a Pauline Epistle thats divinely inspired
Cause all men need Jesus just like air to your lung
So in order to truly live dawg I dare you to come
Stop trying to do it yourself like McNabb on the run
Cause no man is worthy enough to compare to the Son
Or foot the bill for our sin that no money can pay
So all your good works now are worthless without faith
And, only Jesus Christ can truly free Pimp C
Even if he get up out of prison dawg he still ain't free
So remember without him we're a heartbeat from hell
Confess the name and rep him well before your heartbeat fails

Song:   I See the Lord
Typed by: Byg_Balla

[Verse One]
Cast down my crown to worship you in spirit and truth
As I see You on the throne, I see Your train fills the roof
I'm on bended knees, hands extended closed eyes
Holy, Holy, Holy is Lord the Most High
Woe is me, I'm a man with unclean lips
And I live amongst a people whose on the same trip
That when one Seraphim flew to me with coal in his hands
He touch me on my lips, said I was a brand new man
As the foundation shook He's asking, who shall He send
I said, "Send me Lord, I commit to faithful men"
Sometimes Lord, I feel like I don't give you enough
The kind of pure joy to persevere when times get tough
So I keep a concentrated relationship fixed on you
I keep my eyes to the hills so I can have a right view
I stand in awe of You
How You measured the earth with the palm of Your hand
and yet, and still you want to be friends with such an unclean man
So like John I fall prostrate on this island of life
I worship You, recognizing you are power and might
Glory and light, eternal in sight, blameless and right
Creator of life, thief in the night, Jesus the Christ

[Chorus]
I see the Lord, seated on the throne, exalted
And the train of His robe, fills the temple with glory
And the whole earth is filled, and the whole earth is filled
And the whole earth is filled, with His glory

[Verse Two]
The sun suspends in the air
I can feel Your winds everywhere
You care to the grains of my hair
Divine works all around me
I can't get past the evidence
The fact that your invisible, to me, is irrelevant
I know your heaven sent, straight to the virgin birth
Gave me a second chance even after man's curse
A third, a fourth, a fifth, and a sixth
You wore my crown of thorns, you took my licks as they spit
In ya face, off the cross a sinner you embraced
Now I understand whats the meaning of grace
I war against the flesh, can't wait till the day that you come
Cause everday I'm rewriting Psalm 51
From the weak to the dumb
You make us shine like Pearls
Got a new engagement, broke up with that girl named world
The relationship was unfruitful, I was Satan's pupil
They told me you was an unfair God, I believed those lies
I know the truth now, cuz you've been fair since creation
Man fell, and then you gave man emancipation
I know the saying one sin can make man fall
But with one drop of blood, he can save us all
I'm a living sacrifice, I lay my life upon the altar
I pray to have faith that don't forsake you, like a martyr
I have a desire, thats to know you more
I have no choice to live holy cuz I see the Lord

[Chorus]

[Isaiah 6]
For Whole earth is full of his glory
And the foundations of the threshold tremble
At the voice of him who called out
While the temple is filled with smoke
I said to myself Woe is me
For I am ruined
Because I'm a man with unclean lips
And I live amongst a people with unclean lips
For my eyes have seen the king, the Lord of Hosts
Then one seraphim flew to me
With burning coals in his hand
He touched me on my lips
Said my iniquity is taken away, and my sins forgiven
Then I heard the voice of the Lord say
Who shall I send?
Who will go for us
Then I said
Here I am, Send Me

Aiyyy, tu eta por llamaseta mi amor, Linda, ahahahaha!

We wanna rock, YOU!
We're the kings of swing
	And we're chosen to rule
The deans of clean inside the cool school
	We're the chiefs of relief
Contained by wild beasts
	The finesse of the West, the masterpiece of the East
Hah, the boss of course
	As the lord of our fort
The ones with the platinum vocal chords
	We're the science of desire
With a magical mic
	The monarch of the dark in the night alright
We advertise
	And specialize
In the exercise and we'll energize
	The young ladies thighs
Cause all the fly guys
	Nature's to rise right before their eyes
We're the Earl of the world
	And the Air of flair
The Duke of dare, the Mayor of debonaire
	Got fine, drink wine
Can dance and dine
	Got a first class female oh so fine

	[Chorus]
Hey baby, whatever you doin right girl
I just want you to always be easy, and keep on shakin that thing
and I want you -- swingin it swingin it swingin
	Tell me how now
Like dy-na-mite before it blows
Who needs a band when the beat just goes -- boom!

He's Grandmaster, he cuts faster
We're the Furious, serious, and ever so mysterious
Five that's rockin the house

And everybody say PLAY (PLAY)
Say PLAY (PLAY) well OK!

Ho!  Everybody c'mon!
Woo!  Now now!  Uhh!

People call me crazy, people call me sneak
Just because I'm nasty, they call me a freak, hehe
I am coming over, to your house tonight
I promise to you baby, that I'll do you right, I'm nasty!

I wantcha, I wantcha, I wantcha, I wantcha (shake your booty)
I wantcha, I wantcha, I wantcha, I wantcha (we want to rock you)
	Just let us rock, you!

Watch your girl and watch your wife
I got the kiss of death, to touch your life
Cause I am the man they call Scorpio
I like fly girls that don't say no

Hey girl, grab my hand, hold on tight
Don't you worry bout a thing Raheem'll do you right
I'm a mint that's fresh huh, a woman's pet
There ain't a thing in the world that I can't get

In the history books or the picture show
It's the golden voice on your radio
I'm the rapper never printed voice is solid gold
I'm playin the role, they call me Kid Creole

And I'm the, the Romeo, of the nasty show
All the ladies in the place, to my house we go
Freakin in the den just to make you move
Cause I'm Cowboy, and I got the groove

As DJ Flash, cuts so mean
That he wanna know your favorite jean
Is it Jordache?  (NO!)  Gloria Vanderbilt?  (NO!)
Maybe it's Sassoon?  (NO!)  How about Sergio?  (I DON'T CARE!)
Could it be Calvin Klein?  (NO!)  Then what is it?  (?????)

Back to the bridge y'all

	[Chorus]

Everybody, shake your body
Keep movin and groovin and screamin and shoutin
and helpin us turn it out

Is everybody sayin play?  (PLAY!)
Say play! (PLAY!)  Well OK!

Alright, woo!
Everybody get up!
Oooooeee, yeah!

People say it's dirty, people say it's wrong
They talk about our music, like it's a nasty song
It's nasty!

I wantcha, I wantcha, I wantcha, I wantcha!
	Just let us rock, you!

Got waterbed sets in my limousine
And everytime I'm seen I got to be clean
I tour around the world, to make the people dance
And here's a little message for the ladies in France
Je m'appelle, Melle Mel
Donne moi la petit mademoiselle
Donne moi cinq, donne moi six
Donne moi huit, neuf, dix

I'm seein this girl that I just adore
I'm seein this girl that what I never saw before
The way she was swaying and doing the swing
I had to let her know just about my thing
I'm the M, R, N E-Double S
Come on, ah fly girl, and put me to a test
and I'll rock you, until you give me the rest
I keep on it, until you start to fess

Raheem, in your life, what more can you ask
I bet you can't think of a greater task
I make my light shine on your cloudy days
You can surf if you want to, on my waves
I caress your soft body on those mellow nights
A continuous thing, to the morning light
It's reality, it's not a dream
It's nothing less than the best when it's from Raheem

Now it's my turn so understand
That I'm the Kid Creole, and I'm a ladies man
I don't, have a lot of women hangin on my steez
Only one fine lady that you better believe
I say Annette's her name, and that's the truth
I give a lot of things up, before I turn her loose
It's just her, and that's simple and plain
And that's the only way I run my game

Well I'ma, Cowboy and I'm the real McCoy
I'm chocolate all over like an Almond Joy
Bowlegged cool brother and you will agree
On top of the world for the ladies to see
Gonna hip gonna hop gonna rock the spot
Gonna make everybody wanna rock rock rock
Gonna do it to the East, wanna do it to the West
Gonna make you relax right upon your chest

Grandmaster Flash, is willing and able
He's the king of the cuts on two turntables
He's the GRAND, GRAND, the master man
He's so nice with his hands he don't need no band
Rocks 45's, and 33's
Rocks boys men women and young ladies
He can slice so precise it's almost fun
And he makes better love than a mick makes money

Slick Rick, Slick Rick, Slick Rick, Slick Rick
Slick Rick, Slick Rick (ha ha hah hah hah), hooooooo-ho!!
Owwwwwwwwwwwwwwww!

Nigga You betta get cha money
Fuck dat I'm tired of bein broke Daz
Let's go get our chips
 
[Daz]
That nigga Daz on the street at a early age
Barely made it out da twelfth grade
But the man will still stay paid
Stayed away from the little homies who wanted to play basketball
All up on it money was fast life was all
These niggaz blew em and presumed it was all like cling
It seems it wont be long to buy a composite dream
Call up the homie Syke
Meet me at the market it's a heist
60 G's a piece its big money on the street gotta have it
Whenever I bone gotta make it better 
Whether I'm rich or broke my eye is to stay clever
It's a jack move so motherfucker don't say nothin'
Stop the teller give up the cash bitch don't say nothin
Fatal pull up quickly wit tha ride
So we hop inside countin the money wit my dogs feelin high
Bought a new riviera oh deez from ?? on G's
Do whatever I feel Jackers know the deal
Keep the pistol loaded and cocked
Right now I move the block
When I kick fuck the whole hood is getting licked
Say what Dogg pound got love underground
Along with my homie from the town that bump the ground

[Big Syke]
I trapped inside my self I needa change my ways
Niggas get shot to death searchin for better days
Peepin out the heist pay the price if you wanna ball
After all get yo niggaz it's the final call
I can't stall Daz put me on the liquor hit
Cause I'm fed up and tired of that broke shit
Steady on the grind I got to get mine who wanna die
Starvin and broke don't multiply stay high
Im neck deep I cant sleep wit no dividends
I play to win livin in the sin will it end
So let the G ride slide county state to state
Cause I wont hesitate to distentigrate
One time evil mind thuggin cartel
I kill everybody in this motherfucker so give me the mail
I cant tell leave no witnesses I handle my business
Cause I'm full of that sickness Lets do this

[Chorus: Daz]
Its jack move
Muthafucka don't say nothin it's a jack move
Do you really think we bluffin it's a jack move
Give it up mothafucka it's a jack move
Do you really think we bluffin it's a jack move

[Kadafi]
Now as I position myself to the opposition my aim is stacked wealth
In this world of greed
Kadafi calm lyrical bomb easy get me fetully crucified 
Like you was Jesus on the floor spread like diseases
Crack in the hemmy I stay cool locked in the semi
Automatic niggaz jumpin like acrobatics
When static eruct you stuck
Witout a fuckin bucket to piss in 
For all you cowards that's dissin
Heres a bitch named glock for your nuts to be kissin
I said it just like the midnight moves
From nights to afternoon get cooked up like coke in a spoon
Protect your body from repeated shots from my fuckin shotty
Layin it down wit my road dawg Hussein Kadafi
Cuttin ya ear ta ear 
Spinnin these niggaz headgear
Like I'm county bound 
Whilein from tear ta tear
Shootin and poluttin this atmosphere 
Wit cakes and aches awaits through the fuckin state 
Tryin ta come up in this world cuz its money we make

[Napolean]
I got some niggaz back in jerzey and most of em dead
I got some killa niggaz in cali cuz most of em said
That when the jump lick lead
From murderton to the plauge we getting down for whats said 
That its based on the feds 
So nigga heres my documentary
Started in elementary 
Nigga gotta speak soft to the street because it befriended me
Drinkin my hennesy listen to moonie cause hes schoolin me
Lickin shots at the cops bless the dead rest in peace ta boonie
Now its on cause like a reef I'm comin home 
And when dem niggaz hit the streets we goin shoppin for chrome
Keep it known that I'm shootin and fuck the world I'm pollutin
If it keep pursuein ima turn my business to lootin
Near no nigga can stop me from bein young and cocky 
Betta take me the way you see me or a mothafucka or drop me
Told my grams I'm a killa Bad boy n she feel it
My people told me bout the secretz of war I cant spill it
Got four four four dem hoes 
Plenty counted for hoes 
I'm Drinkin ginsing now watch me get this bitch out her clothes
See yall niggaz want more
What ima give you for sure
Is a couple hot ones to the dome and leave you creepin back home
My niggaz call me Napol move top for dem hoes
Thinkin of creepin on yo block to leave yo punk ass froze
My niggaz rose from they graves
Teach me how to dip strays
This thug life that I'm livin is like a game but it pays

[Chorus]

[Hussein Fatal]
What tha fuck you think this is hands up everybody spread em
First motherfucker move yaki kadafi wet em
Aint nobody getting out alive 
If I don't get the amount I came for
Plus a motherfuckin ounce
And bounce cuz I'm on that kind of shit nobody knowin
Alias hussein everybody who look strange I'm blowin
I got the blood from ya body blowin haulin ass
With daz and money bags and the ass of the shottie showin
Play the hero I bring the heat to the street
Like Al pacino and Deniro eliminate twenty muthafuckaz to zero
Watch me the streets is black hockey rules of the game 
To never let a cop top me

[Kurupt]
The jack is on from noon to the crack of dawn
Me and my niggaz storm attack vietnam swarm
You cant stop me I shoot with loot drop it
Rip ya arms out they socket
Cause you aint quick enough to empty ya pockets
The homies stole 10 G's is the plot
We got a lot at stake first nigga make a sound get shot
So I'm set no sweat never catch me sweatin
No regrets I aint regrettin all the shit that I'm gettin
And I keep my mind state clear 
Posessin no fear
No need to look no further nigga I'm here
I gots da ammo
I also gots the ride ta roll
We gots the plot and got the route
That gets to the pot uve gold
Its good as go I'm in the position
Ready to unload all the ammunition
On spots count my riches hit the yaucht and go fishin
Then confuse of course it goes smooth 
You at the right place the wrong time then its you and ya crue
It's a jack move...

Song:   Hit the Jackpot
Typed by: nelly@itis.com

Intro:
There's a first time for everything and we have come to that time
From this moment on we will now take people to the top of the world
When they discovered us they hit the jackpot yo
I bet they all wanna hit the jackpot though
but you gotta pay dues to hit the jackpot homie
now presenting the one and only, USU...

Hook:
You can't win if you don't play, HEY HEY HEY (x3)
Looks like it's time to get paid we hit the jackpot

Zeb:
Now for the U Sound shot givin' up what I got 
It's a lot cause I'm hot wreckin' the spot
Sensation for your nation, man I use to be patient
The floor is wondering will I ever got to go on tours
But then I stare plickeded I just kick wicked flows
And where will it stop? Nobody knows
I'm straight up Park Side Avenue on the east coast
Four years back make a track to the west (never the less)
All the Philly homies still clock snap clots
But in Phoenix they got gats to bust caps (bang bang)
Cause ain't nothing gonna change it's sll staying the same
So I remain whipped how it goes to make a name for me
Say Abdula microphone ruler
The skills to be ill kids be chill cause I can school ya
Like my man Schooly carrying a toolie
In the streets listen to beats no one can fool me
(Now planet Earth get down) we use sound
There's only a few down with us cause I don't trust
Too many, but I bet we make a penny or two
Just doing just what we do at the U.S.U. 
And it's like that, flex and I'll fight back
I'm strapped and I'm black and attack with phat raps
Something to kick the doors in like cops at crack spots
Zeb is through you as you just hit the jackpot

Hook
Scratching "hit it"
Hook

MTL:
Here we come but were we from
Homies the ones and onlys
MTL it's the motor mic cable stable
Plus my DJ's willing and able on his one and two turn table
Down with Trouble Makers (no fakers)
Ground breakers may be comfortably rolling luxury Japanese
Cars always find us where the happening are
Super phat production build beats like construction
Iller then the criminal that perform sudduction
Everything MTL say I wrote on my own paper
Constantly compose underground capers
Nothing can stop us yet, rhymes I'm a major threat
Bounty hunter like Boba Fett, pulling snaps don't fret
Or fuss cause you just can't trust
The style when I make it wild then switch it up
Now your stuck out of luck we will blow up like nuclear war struck
And I'll be damn if can you duck
And I keep props stack like jackpot got stacks of cash 
Nothing small for the man who wins it all
Cause life is like luck if you don't have some 
Then you can't get none understand now son?
I mean sick man kids with no sense usually get rich
That's why me crew Trouble Makers won't switch
My mind's sick but smart like a professor
Not a crackpot, MTL is through the U.S.U. just hit the jackpot

Hook (x2)

When I was one years old I made my first dollar bill
Ever sincee then I grew big and not small but still
There was times in my life when dad was straight broke
But now a lot of folks know my song is no joke
So everyone around get down to what I got
Not confusing but I'm bruising anyone that trys to take my jackpot

A lot of people pull the lever but no one can give a reason better
That we should keep here together forever
And a mystical magnificent mysterious miracle man
Has a dramatic lyrical plan 
Blueprints to make gens turn to fat bank accounts
Think about what you wish cause it's something you may get
We wrote this song for 92 then remixed it for 96
As times goes by quick U.S.U. ain't do hit jackpot thick
Yo you can't win if you don't play, HEY HEY HEY
That's how the U.S.U. do we hit the jackpot

Outro:
Yeah and ya don't stop on and on. Word is bond. Hit he jackpots.

Song:   Jello
Typed by: ichor@ap.net

The proof was in the pudding neighborhood called her Jello
My man thought she was thorough - poor fellow!
She fucked more niggaz than legal aid in each borough
Favorite color yellow; cheesy racked tendency profound mellow
The role of a serene sister, I miss her
Undercover gossip put her world in a twister
The setting is a sinister slum where sex ain't sacred
By thirteen she was pro-active and naked
Had a gift to give but she would tend a path not taken
Twenty years old she wishes she was in The Matrix
Years passed mad relationships ain't last
Her esteem was the small amount of sand in her hourglass
I told her she was beautiful she felt the opposite
Had the pieces to the puzzle couldn't find a proper fit
Each time we spoke she said, 'Something gotta give
I'm glad I ain't got a kid cause I don't even want to live!'

Mommy, my sister, her, she
Grandma, auntie, my daughter, my niece
My cousin, my wife, another part of me
Is where it all started see
But now we got chicken, slut, whores, tricks
Skins, ass, pussy, bitch
Hooker, hoodrat, that shit sounds sick!
yigga-yigga-yo watch your lip!

"Get out my mind!" she tells herself time after time
Ignorin words spoke by the most high divine
In her own eyes she was less than prime
So sublime her smile upside down would decorate her lip line
Words note this cry for help by a wise man
Real short attention span, you know man
Parties in her head leave her eyes jam
Tears ran down cheek lane hell she would keep flings
Gave it up for fake things, street gangs, and cheap chains
Slept on the beasts who fiend for sweet dames
Take her stride with guys but yo they was lame
Hijacked a seat on my mental plane
She wanted dedication but kept finding debt bills
No skill, and life ills helped her to strip
She would diet, crying, but didn't notice
Pretty flowers get devoured, now know this
It's like Lauren (flippin in the ghetto on a dirty mattress)
Dreams of being nurse, a school teacher, or an actress
Surrounded by self hate happiness pursued by the sadness
she committed suicide on the Sabbath
Young queen lost she was no longer a girl
Killed by lack of understanding in an ignorant world
She played the roll, but yo her supporting cast
Was every man that lied to her just to get in the ass

[In a whisper]
Mommy, my sister, her, she
Grandma, auntie, my daughter, my niece
My cousin, my wife, another part of me
Is where it all started see
But now we got chicken, slut, whores tricks
Skins, ass, pussy, bitch
Hooker, hoodrat, that shit sounds sick!
yigga-yigga-yo watch your lip!

Mommy, my sister, her, she

Smilin like everything's fine and dandy
Sounded real good when he tried to give a pep talk
To over 30 million poor people like me
How can he say that we gotta stick it out
When his belly is full and his future is sunny
I don't need his jive advice
But I sure do need his jive time money

Land of the free and the home of the brave
But it might as well be the home of the slaves
They got me walkin around singin 'freedom's come'
But my body is free and my mind is dumb
The people ain't black but the house is white
And just because I'm different they don't treat me right
They done cast me aside, held me down
Dragged my name down to the ground
Oh beautiful for spacious skies
And your amber ways of untold lies
Look at all the politicians tryin to do a job
But they can't help but look like the mob
Get up and get back, put it away
Watch the F.B.I. watch the C.I.A.
They want a bigger missile and a faster jet
But yet they forget to ?hidin? the vet

The 30th day, that's in December
Is a day that everybody's gonna remember
Cause on that day a righteous man
Thought about takin a brand-new stand
The name of the man is Jesse Jackson
And his call for peace was loud as action
Cause now's the time to change the nation
But not with just another negotiation
He went to the East for human's rights
To free the lieutenant shot down in flight
Just another statistic, and the government knew it
They didn't even want the man to go do it
Before he left, he called the President's home
And Reagan didn't even answer the phone
But I tell you one thing that's a natural fact
You can bet he called Jesse when Jesse got back

[Sylvia Robinson, Ronald Isley, et al]
He started on the bottom
Now he's on the top

You can be black white or albino yeah
You can have cornrows inside your hair
I give a fuck if I don't like your stare
This bottle of wine goes upside your head
A little bit psycho but I know that
Think you just don't say it and I won't say it
See if you don't brag then I don't brag
I know I'm bad as long as I know I'm bad
I don't need ya'll to co-sign no shit
You can just keept making them tired old threats
Little bit like the boy who cried wolf did
See me but don't dare to try no shit
Cuz you know that somewhere inside those layers
The rattlesnakes right there to bite your ass
And I can be so quite and strike so fast
Like lightening bolts right out the sky go blast
From out of nowhere you might find your career

[Eminem]
You jealous little fucks beg for my attention but
I done told you once I'm not the kind of attention you want
If I tell you twice then I won't be so nice
If you keep coming back that only means you know you lost the fight
They wanna talk shit let them talk shit cuz they talk shit
Knowing deep down they really just wanna squash it
Cuz no one wants to walk around steppining dog shit
And get doo doo on their shoe again as soon as they wash it
But the pride won't let em inside they like go get em
And I'm just like why you trying to fight momentum
We just keep winning by landslides oh an um
Shady Limiteds in any size yo denim to velour
Even our clothing lines on fire
As 50 would said our clothing lines on FIRE
Meanwhile your mind's on us like mine's on Mariah
And you all just like her your all fucking liars
But I'll just keep fucking you like I fucked her
Right in the ass with K-Y yessir
So full of joy boy am I absurd
Even Chingy would tell you yeah boy don't curr

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
Your homie got clapped on, man I don't care

It is what it is dog man life's not fair
Your friends should have known not to front 'round here
Listen kid where I'm from the wolves smell fear
They'll strip your ass of your jewels right here
Man I'm gonna say this one time and get this clear
Man you can catch a hot one like out of no where
Beautiful day without drama is rare
Your girl's a freak man sometimes we share
Yeah I wear a condom and you go bear
You probably heard about me I'm a shown up player
In the hood politicin' like I'm running for mayor
Running winding ?doning? and shining you know what I'm saying
I aint got time for fucking around and horse playing
I'm making hits my homies taking hits whose staying

[Chorus]
See us on the award shows and we're like OH YEAH
Can we get more of those they like OH YEAH
See us keep blowing up we're like OH YEAH
So Jimmy can crack corn but i don't care

Big dawgs, slam the garbage lid

Swoop off, hop off, hit up

Maddogg, start the raucous
From Oxnard to Diego
Affiliated with sin, big Dogg

Hit them corners, test on us, you gettin' nathan

Hit the weed, sit, bleed, ridin' on me
Cock back, hold back, we's them young hoggs

Chorus: Mr. Lil' One

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 2)
[Lil' One] Comin' in, in a Blaster, midgets always askin'

           Now swallow
           Lil' and the Maddogg
           Now swallow
           Follow me, the leader
           Twisted off the meter
           Bleed through my bloodstream
           I had a dream
           Just the other day, about this bitch, Alize
           Fuckin' with my mental
           Instrumental
           Playin' in the background, 'bout to get my mack down
           Wolves always woof
           Bout to get the smackdown
           Cause I really, really don't give a damn
           How you brag and you talk, "You the man"
[Maddogg]  BULLSHIT

Repeat Chorus Twice

[Verse 3: Maddogg]
Fools don't be knowing

Sick motherfuckers
Cummin' while they blowin'
Back from the dead
The evil would spread
Put the chrome, to your dome, fill you with the hot lead
Hollar if you hear me
Cry if you fear me
Weak motherfuckers, death when you see me
You react, contact, shots from the gun blast
I blast
Hot metal burn fast
I'm a killer
Triple six blood spiller
This for realer
Dogg's killin' for the thriller
Say a prayer
Beggin' to your savior
Evil player
I'm the one that hate ya
In the name of the Father, Son and Spirit
You see the light
I got you walkin' near it
I bring hell, when I bail, jive sucker

I'm, I'm, I'm, just, just, blowin' in the wind
Wind, wind, I'm, I'm, just blowin' in the wind
Wind, blowin' in, blowin' in, blowin' in the wind
Wind, wind, wind

[RZA]
Stronger then the locomotive, duffel bags of explosive
Make a savage disappear, like it's magic, hocus pocus
Auto focus memory, like the Canon 7D
Sharing heaven with my brethren, laying up with seventy
Persian virgins made for splurging, for deserving worthiest
Swerving on the merging traffic, boy, I'm impervious
The flack attack cat, on crack-a-lack
And Real Steel, like Hugh Jackman, black man with two mac tens
And two bitches who's computer hacking, when they menstruate, great
They take it through the back end
You got your advance, but I doubt you got your back end
They thought I was out, but they brought me back in
I'm sick like Colombiana, only dick, understands that
Keep an incubated hammer, bammer blast, bark fast
Faster than a camera, grenades and a canister
They fading these amateurs, hip hop, God body
Superman stamina, you better come clean like Jeru the Damaja
Who's your hype man, is he also your manager?
When you get sprayed, does he get paid to bandage ya?
Kid, I will vanish ya, you I know will challenge ya
The God will banish ya, to land far beyond our star spangled banner's up
Better get your manners up, you was just a fan of us
And you could never fuck with the Wu-Tang Clan and us

[Zombie Juice]
Dead walk and leaving foes in coffins
No man alive can bare the shit that I walked in
A brass instrument, vibration from the Iron Fist
Blood drip like rain, pouring amongst men
Walk with God, swing the, sword of a marksmen
Penetrate the seeds, exterminate and defeat
I'm obsolete and you pleed, fear the hate I bring
Cremate like the steam of a cattle
Inhale the breath of the devil, inevitable what we bring
The pleasure, and the pain, the measures in the game
Infecting the world with methods, the chosen unrespected
The martyr, bomb the entire army of liars
Settle down, took it down, bring it down, just a notch
My pride over standing, your soul I'm demanding
Your heart filled with fear, I see it in your eyes
Zombie Gang, nigga, on the rise

[Meechy Darko]
Darkness, darkness, all I see is darkness
Blessed made of bronze, although I believe I am heartless
Impenetrable, fucking, unbreakable
Leave you fake, the humble, overcoming, this is incapable
Cuz pain, is what I cater to, in war, they are casualties
And I bring death to anyone from the free to the shackled feet
We rape and pillage, leave your town in ruins
I don't understand your dance, hate on me is an illusion
And so is fear as well, my rainbow reach through different realms
And we feared in hell, feared in hell
Blood from the foes, soak my tattered clothes
Beneath my toes, lies the mountain piles of gold
Who chose to go against the most, unstoppable foes
Thinking you can stop the unstoppable, think you just froze
I'm the light, I'm the dark, I'm the right, I'm the wrong
Man of Bronze, meets the Iron Arm
Premonition while I'm writing scriptures on the Iron Horse

Craig G nigga
Yeah, yeah nigga
Uh huh
This is how we gon' do this shit right here
Let me just take you niggas back real quick
Listen, listen here

Yo yo yo
It goes a 1-2-3, 3, the 2-1
My man Larry Lye, his name's DJ Run
Thats what I used to listen to in 1983
Eleven years old
Four years since I chose to be an emcee
Seven on the scene, mop necks, ???
On the mic over there in the park by the water
Come from outta town to the Bridge, and try to sound like you tough
end up on the black strip and get slaughtered
But I was too young to run with those older niggas and their guns
Plus this music had me strung, I got more rhymes than a bank got duns
Sounds funny now, but it was the shit at the time
High Fedelity blew every house party
Back on Vernon, but I was just a youth, I was learnin
Thats what you need to do, first be a student then a tutor
If not then this verse will kill ya future, motherfucker

Chorus [Voice]
Oooohh, life is much too cruel (much too cruel)
I can't change for you (change for you)
I'll keep doing me (doing me)
While you keep doing you (ooohhhh)
Life is much too cruel (much too cruel)
I can't change for you (change for you)
I'll keep doing me (doing me)
While you keep doing you (ooohhhh)

[Craig G]
I seen Grand Wizard Theodore cut with cuffs in the reese
Back when I rocked the light beige sheet
In hip hop my life plays deep
Fuck around with the wrong niggas and they might spray heat
Listen here, I'm from 4117 apartment 2A
Fuck around, and nigga, on the ground you lay
Crab niggas fake jacks like there's five in a deck
Tellin ancient war stories as if they earning respect
I roll dolo, but my crew of personalities swarm
When I perform, you stay locked on like the cells of the dorms
At eleven half asses emcees heads I'm severing
From the neck above, you get no respect or love
You can take it with the lyrics or hand in hand with the glove
I come ninety six buildings of drama, drugs, and slugs

Craig G nigga
Lets take 'em back nigga
Its like that nigga what?

See your boy plottin, talkin 'bout you got steel
That's gonna get you popped, probably get your ass killed
I see you little motherfuckers, up in it, can't chill
I hear your heart pumpin brothers don't think it can't spill
I came from Louisiana, bananas get peeled
This ain't no propaganda, my knocker that's real
Ain't promotin no violence, just encitin violence, nigga chill
And if I said not to move, then you motherfuckers be still
Chopper ain't in the driver's side, that a make your man yield

Jump in the car, flip the God and roll a blunt (yee!)
You can't see, your boy's from Miami
Ears like Sammy Sosa, bitch we're takin over
Bags underneath my eyes, I ain't sleep in days
I'm in the bushes with a K, your semi's gonna spray
Eat mangos and grapes, as your body decay
Bunny holes and yay, you had us in ninth grade
Hey what can I say, alligator suflay

Wife beater chinchillas, life can't get no realer, nigga

And you don't stop

[ VERSE 1 ]
Rappers grow, develop flows, do shows, get hoes
Make it big, then start steppin on toes
But you missed one, mine, now you can't last
Step on my toe, you get ten toes up that ass
Don't even think about tryin some snake shit
Okay, today we're talkin about fake shit
Was it a friend or colleague, tell me what was it?
You flipped your script when you got your bullshit budget
You went gold and can't speak no more
Fuck you, your crew, and your fuckin tour
Poppin shit behind my back, time to get got 
The penalty for that is five to ten speed-knots 
I'm here to bully and bogart, I hit hard 
Set em up to get wet up, dump em in somebody's yard
Tie em up and make em squeel
The last three words he hears is 'keep it real'

Keep it real
And you don't stop
(And I'ma let you know)
Keep it real
(Probably a punk)

[ VERSE 2 ]
Industry rule number 4080-one
(If you come to battle, bring-bring a shot-shotgun)
I hate the fake, if you perpatrate, flee
Time to wreck shop, and all you can do is stop speakin to me
MC's that get too big for their britches
End up in stitches or gettin robbed for their fuckin riches
Forgot where you came from, gased up
Go back to your old block and niggas smack that ass up
You know the rules, challenge him to a rap scrimmage
Sha said (Yo, 'Pache chill, that's just his image 
And shit) So I chill and won't say shit, see
No bull, I got pull, only a handful can fuck with me
Bringin mysery is my mission in '93
So be nice and think twice before steppin to me
Tie him up and make him squeel
The last three words he hears is 'keep it real'

[ VERSE 3 ]
Some new fame is like a flame, let me explain
It can blaze for days, then it's out, but who's to blame?
You, or is it the things you do or did?
In fact, sometimes I think back to when I was a kid
Times were hard, I got harder
Couldn't afford a 40, so you didn't wanna be bothered
Wouldn't pass a spliff, couldn't get a lift
Started runnin with the Flavor U and got swift
Now you come around talkin that 'we boys' shit
The way I live, I forgive, but I don't forget
Tie him up and make him squeel
The last three words he hears is 'keep it real'

The heads shakin as we smash these
Flakes makin cash, we crash these
Straigh fakin gangsters
I'm keepin it real

I'm the educated, underrated, overstated
Suckers made it, suckers played it, suckers raided
Don't you hate it how they faded
All the great except the latest
Style created by the greatest
Rappin, rhymin, rhythmic climbin
Funky timin, rhyme designin
Lyric chimin, hard as diamond
Yes, it's mine and I'm inclinin

I never hit you with the fake hard barn yard 
Country bumpkin facade, bogart
Bunch of frontin upstart, undercarred
Up-and-comin rappers, yo
I'm keepin it real

I'm tired of hearin all the bang-bang
Same thang as everybody shots ring
Gangs gain momentum as the rap game's slang change
And ain't nobody really
Keepin it real

I'm the innovating, motivating
Stimulating, elevating, resonnating
Renovating, emulating, perpetrating
Combinating, denegrading
Escalating, dominating
Insane, mondaine, no name lame brain
Rappers came to entertain
The same game, gain fame
And get a name, but ain't nobody

I'm never comin with the fly guy, get high
Image of a rye dry white lie
Givin us a closed eye, why die
Before I hit the heavens, yo
I'm keepin it real

I got to get it while I'm on Earth, re-birth
My ancestors were here first, dispersed
By what you heard with each verse I reversed
The image of a ghetto, yo
Keepin it real

No stereotypical, nothin is typical
Comin like a God or a mythical figure, my visual's
Somethin like a magical mystical force of residuals
On the mic I'm flier than digital, more like a ???
I drop it like a Amville, stand still
Sit back and watch a man build and chill
As I proceed the plan will slam, kill
Anybody aimin, yo
I'm keepin it real

Give me my money!)
Beggars can't be choosers, huh?
Uh-huh, listen

Dollar, dollar bill ya'll
Everybody lookin' for somethin'
Can make you wanna kill, ya'll
You can't get somethin' for nothin'

Work hard and play even harder
Gotta save up all my nickels and quarters
Can't ask you for a handout
It's time to be a man now

I don't need it, you can keep your money
I don't want it if you gonna throw it up in my face
I'm still leavin', you can keep your money
Because you ain't worth the time
Can't let it go to waste

(Money) Makes the world go 'round
(M-m-money) Makes the world go 'round
I'm hungry and you got me goin' (give me my money!)
I'm hungry and you got me goin' (give me my money!)

Temporary lay off
Guess that all the good times are over
When will it ever pay off?
I guess I didn't know when to fold em'

Work long, so I can play all the time
Gotta save up all my nickels and dimes
Can't ask you for a handout
It's time to be a man now

I don't need it, you can keep your money
I don't want it if you gonna throw it up in my face
I'm still leavin', you can keep your money
Because you ain't worth the time
Can't let it go to waste

Rockin that Versace shit way before Migos (Migo)
Started with them dams at the project with a stack
Then I flipped it to a brick and then I did the Project Pat (hah)
Like, homie what's the problem? Save me or revive em
Catch a nigga with the bricks, you know we goin' rob em
Once I caught the liquor we was fresh up out the drop
Man the bitches on the corner watch a player like the scout
I said all I wanted was a kilo (kilo), all them bitches wanna free load (load)
All I wanted was a drop with the head cracked like Cee Lo (WHOO)
36 them O's nigga (hah), thousand grams on gold nigga (hah)
Power plants at the broke nigga (hah), BC, coke boys nigga (hah)
Army come, pistol on me, smoking on California

[Yo Gotti]
Ain't no refunds nigga - wanna get your money back?
Best bring your guns nigga - and no receipts in the streets
All sales, you know they found a nigga; so if you lose some then it's your loss
If you don't way up then scale off, if you trap right it'll pay off

Song:   Know You Better
Typed by: Cedmaster3K

[Intro: Omarion]
Haha, yeah, I'mma let it ride
I'm just tryna know you better

[Pusha T]
Let's start with the basics, your in seam, where your waist is
Nail color, shoe size, what designer's your favorite?
Trick dollar, I plays this, couple niggas you played with
Kenzo, gift bags for all the bitches you came with
These niggas on the same shit, Red Lobster, Red Bottom
Sell dope, dough fake, next day, fed's got 'em
Rrrrah~! But I'm still here, you see I'm still here
A lot of niggas just came and went but at least you know that it's real here
Fly you down to where the Heat go, lay you out to where the beach go
Jet ski, parasail, yacht as big as my ego (WOO!)
Heart cold as ever, but I can show you better
If we're gonna roll together, I gotta get to know you better

[Omarion]
Tell me what's your name, tell me, tell what's your sign
Tell me what you into, tell me, tell what you like
If you were rich tomorrow tell me what would you do with it?
And if you could see the future, baby do you see me in it?
Would you date me for a minute, girl before you let me hit it?
Are you single? Are you taken? Working towards your education?
I'm just askin, I'm just sayin, what's your current situation?
Cause I see you 'cross the room and you the baddest in the building, what's up?

[Interlude: Omarion]
See I don't wanna get into your draws yet (oh yeah)
Are you one of them girls that's askin' where the bread's at? (Oh yeah)
See first I need to know the way your head at
Before you give me some.. (heh, I'm playin')

[Chorus: Omarion]
I'm just tryin' to know you, better
I'm just tryin' to know you, yeah
I'm just tryin' to know you, better
I'm just tryin' to know you, yeah-eah-eah
If I told you my secret, shawty would you keep it?
Are you the type to kiss me right after I beat it, yeah?
I'm just tryin' to know you, better...

[Omarion]
Tell me where you goin', tell me, tell me where you from
Are you a smoker or a drinker? Are you none of the above?
Are you more domesticated? Do you love to hit the club?
Tell me do you like to fuck, or do you just like making love?
Tell me do you have some kids? And if so girl, how many?
And if not, then shawty tell me, can I be your baby daddy?
I'm just playin less you let me, I won't know unless you tell me
I just gotta ask cause girl you super bad, what's up?

[Interlude] + [Chorus]

[Fabolous]
Niceee...
Are you single? Are you datin'? Is it kinda complicated?
Did you hear that time is money, are you bein' compensated?
Did you fuck first night and spent the next day contemplatin'?
Did you focus givin' head? Baby were you concentratin'?
These the things I wanna know...do I really wanna know?
In a time where everybody's high and nothing's on the low
And the always on the go, snappin' pictures in Miami
Swear you take the best pictures, you should win a Instagrammy
And I give her compliments while wonderin' who bought her that
Let her do that thing I like, wonderin' who taught her that
Wanna know you better (know you better), but I know better (I know better)
Cause I left her (I left her), then O met her

I'd like to introduce you to a true rhyme sayer
Born Californian in west LA-er
I like to hear the beat right under the snare
And my love hold tight like you huggin a bear (OK player)

Players and playerettes and babies and pimps
Ready, Set, Go let your mind connect
Maybe even you ladies with the funny cigarettes
And my man playin the backboard like he was a vet
I mean, check my scroll again when I come rollin in
Strollin in holdin in my hand a mighty scepter
I'm in ya sector, I'm ya selector
Don't worry about nothing I'm gon be ya party protector
All I want you to do is just move with the record
Master ya high and control ya laker
I'm stylin and growl like a German Sheppard
I just come through clean like the heath inspector (OK Player)

And my love hold tight like you huggin a bear (Yeah, OK player)

As long as your feelin good that's all that matters
But don't get caught in the same old patterns
Look to the sky and climb up the ladder
Cuz I mix up the batter like a real mad hatter
People get together it's a beautiful thing
With the beat drop down like that's the swing
Hit the mic screamin like I wanna be king
And keep the party rockin like “What did he bring?”
I brought love and a gang of choppers
A lil something new for ya regular shopper
Break 'em off proper and get my propers
Pull out the stoppers (Yeah, OK Player)

OK player, pull up a chair

And my love hold tight like you huggin a bear (Yeah, OK player)

When I get to rockin the house they stop and stare
Hands ain't the only thing they put in the air
The night gets bright when I light the flare
(OK player OK Player)
Fellas in the house let me know if ya there
Ladies scream if you got clean underwear
Bonecrusher said he'd never be scared
And Andre said he'd lay in ya hair
Me I'm so smooth and debonair
My style so rare, beyond compare
Kinda like the people living under the stair (OK Player)

Shadow in San with my dog, Bad Boy
Javie Lopez track, you know how we do this shit
West coast, motherfucker

[Verse 1: Mr. Shadow]
Heads turn with concern when I bend the block
You motherfuckers don't learn that I'm burnin' hot
Only G's on my team always ready to bust
Make G's everyday, in green paper, we trust
Check your nuts cause the streets ain't givin' a fuck
Me and my shadow on the hunt, gettin' rid of you punks
Gun carriers
Eliminate your whole area
Mass destruction, make your family bury ya
I'm way ahead of you snitches and haters
Bitches take pictures, yeah, they say, we're the greatest
Perpetrators ain't allowed in my vacinity
Fuck around and get blood in your facility (Pop)
Your tranquility will fade to none
Cause I'm that bald motherfucker with the loaded gun
Holdin' everyone responsible
Motherfucker
I'm the reason why they say that anything is possible

[Mr. Shadow]
Motherfucker

Chorus: Ant Dog
Fuck 'em all, they wanna bank it
We rarely
Advise before you make a move or (???) can't be daily
Talkin' big shit, but ain't got the balls to face me
Fully loaded clip, no mask, all safety

[Kokane]
West coast and we rock the most
For all my gangstas and all my hoes
You know, Bad Boy and them
He some crazy ass Mexicans
Well, good Lord

[Verse 2: Bad Boy]
I'm in the S.D.
Smokin' lye immensely
Shadow in the drop, throwing up the S-3
You sexy, ma, won't you stop and let's freak
Dick's about as big as the size the checks be
I'm serious, you been sweet since scent of sticks
I fuck around it
Now let me say my synopsis
Then fuck rap
I'm just in it for dividens
Addicted to the streets, bitches sweet as cigarettes
I got a question
Who the hardest in it?
It's us, homie, stop ya feelin'
It's the lyrical rappin' phantom, I blast at 'em
Dippin' up and watch, I spit and backstab 'em
The gat clapper
Call me the Madd Rapper
You actin' rap, back turd, the gat'll gat ya
And I'm done, leave ya twisted, dude
Leave you bitches like some pigeon fool

Motherfucker

Repeat Chorus

Well, good Lord

[Verse 3: Mr. Shadow]
When I aim at your frame, you will see the light
They ain't taking me in without putting a fight
Damn right, I'm a west side G for real
Pack steel, then roll around with intentions to kill
I'm the king of my own hill
Make ya blood spill
Quick, motherfucker, still down to let ya heart squeal
I once killed in bigger bills, no question
Pushed on the whips for rainy days, no stressin'
Got blessed on my so-called riders
Dead on arrival, no chance for survival
You're wearing blindfolds, you can't see Shadow
And if you did, it's on local rap channel
Plenty of ammo with extra clips
And you can bet ya punk ass that your wig'll split
Spit game at your trick cause she loves the dick
Me and my gangsta Bad Boy, criminal shit
Bitch

[Mr. Shadow]
Motherfucker

Repeat Chorus

[Kokane]
West coast and we rock the most
For all my gangstas and all my hoes

Gotta a hit a lick with methazine
Shit nigga I need the cash
Better give it bitch before I smash your ass
I'll reach to grab and i'll start to stash
I'm running down the block with heat in the hands

Mutherfucker recognize I need to jack
They saw my face now they wanna kill me
But bitch recognize im a reckless G
I'm a theif, A raw, I steal for real
Thats why they call me little Vill
So mutherfucker make the deal

We need to eat, we got kids nigga
Why you thinking I'm grinding nigga
On the mic but staying hard
All my mutherfucking blacks on boulevard
I swear to god man shit getting hard
And I pray to you look out for my daughter
Cause one day shit might get sour
All mighty dollar work in your hour
All for the love of money and power
From the north just like a coward

(Chorus):

[Grimm]
Man I cutted me another set of ki's knocking at my door
Should I cover that or promise back 36 more
Make that twelve twenty four before my feet hit the floor
Bubble that brought back when I see steve at the store
Coke dealer fa sho the next connecter coming through
Gotta run the dope cant let the dope run through you
One truth from the start ill leave you stuck in the end
Believe its nothin to him to see you sucking up wind
Youve been told now I kept you known go about you business
The risk is live it to your life, and live this
The dreams oversees the world is yours to for
Take what you can get and pass that on to more people
No secrets, no second chances, no paid advances
No snatches, no ranches in Texas and Kansas
The times done got hard, years dont feel short
This games flipped apart im drifting apart but...

(Chorus):

[Ikeman]
I got the fever for a flavor, I been thinking bout a major
Stacking paper thats my nature, pull a stunt to major capers
Big Ike im a keep it gangsta light it up and pour my drank up
With intentions just to gank ya, take a toke till a nigga thank ya
I'm a gangsta cock the rugger, I got killers and I got Hoodlums
I got Mexicans that'll do ya plus some young niggaz that'll school ya
You got pulled and im a rush ya, im that one that jacks the hustla
I'm a gangsta motherfucker known to knock me off a buster
And lately I been peepin I been creepin while you sleepin
Instead of seekin like im fiend ya for the dope to even keepin it
I'm in a Lincoln thinking throwed cause my homie gets the throwed
Up off the dope, but with a home, sixty G's and twenty fours
Stupid hoes to spit the game, give me the pussy then slang
For your weed and your change and if you bleed then we the same
So we can bust or we can spray, it aint no trust up in this game
So im a jack and im a slang and I done tried but I cant change, but..

If I fall off again mayne, I'm runnin in the bank
You know I stay about that jacking, killing, robbing, and thugging

[Nas]
Yo, foes decompose in their coffins, hoes creeping with bosses
No sleeping my fortress break day thinking of losses
Taxes and IRS government gangstas
But I'm a scientist in love with big president faces
My residence changes from ghetto to acres
Avoiding jealousy snake shit
Can't afford another felony lake bent, driving them Porsche
Niggas saying Nas came through with a flying saucer 
With some strange shoes on the tiring flossing
So now they now wanna offer 'em killing stick 'em and cost 'em
Catch him slipping, tripping get 'em for all his fortune
What's up with this Nas hatred? Y'all can suck my dick
Got these niggas wives naked making them fuck my fist
My mystique have the world froze
My physique got me dressed up in shell toes
And ganja leaf, I inhale slow
I'm from out of town capsule some kind of portal
Spitting these rhyme at you like a my mortal

[Chorus: V-12]
Lay low, lay low (lay low)
'Cause all y'all niggas know (y'all niggas)
If you come to QB you're gon' get murdered 
(You're gon' get murdered, murdered, murdered)
You're gon' get murdered (Why get shot up?)
If you come to QB you're gon' to get murdered

[Lake]
Same old dudes that jewel me, now salute me
I've grew more than they ever though I would be
Having no pops to mourn me, just show me
God didn't plan for another man to control me
You know me from busting my gun blood
But even up north my cell smell like Christian Dior
Before I lost my case I had to gain mastered
Been had heart now my papers starting to match it
I stack 'til they capture me and kept a bottle of half-a-G
And sold 20's while I rap to beats
My wifey beef over my robberies
But they've put my mans in the "L" still on the armory
Loyal to the heritage, though I put seven in it
Dude snaked me, word to Spanky, I never snitch
I put a bullet in your face 'fore I go to Jake
Rule number one out here; DON'T FUCK WITH LAKE

[Chorus: V-12]

[Nas]
Yo, yo, yo, yo
Our guns are haunted with the ghost of bodies
Smoke 'em like we supposed to
Your whole crew comes face to face with shotty
Told you! Bravehearted, we appear when it's on
Light up your block like its day time y'all niggas be gon'
So many niggas that's be pursuing Nas, when they spot me
They be jumping out of moving cars and landing on my Timbs
I tell 'em be careful don't damage the skin
Amateurs cram around with the hopes to get glance at the end

[Lake]
Ayo most of my friends have ulterior motives
I'm wise 'cause I now realize that sound is golden
Mourned shorty, from cat shacky who wrote to me
Living through them back then was giving hope to me
I control many, being a flossiest
Most notorious, Queensbridge extortionist
Love my hood no question, I'ma rep it
But I'm not just a QB tenant, I'm the President

My Roley say 2 but the time is 3
Even though my watch wrong yeah the time so right
Ain't sellin no dreams, I ain't tellin no lies
That dress so cold, but that body on fire
Ain't the smartest in the world, but lookin at you girl
I'll be a fool to let the chance go by - so I'm gone

[Chorus: Omarion] + {Biggie samples}
{Ask you what your interests are - who you be with}
Convince you that I'm the one you should leave with

This conversation leads, us
To the bedroom we gon' make, love
Cause girl I wanna please you
Girl I really need you, so

Let's talk about you and me

Can't take my ey-ey-eyyes off you
Pop a few bottles like the first of the year
Stare so right, and your visual probably better
But I came over just to make things clear
No disrespect girl, we both so grown
Just want you by my side, when I say solo
Been paying attention, nigga steady missin
Turning you off, let me turn you on - so I'm gone

[Chorus]

[Rick Ross]
She lookin like a bag of money
Like a boss, so you know I let her count it for me
Like to floss, new watch, gold rings
People next door swear I'm dealing cocaine
Me and O, gettin dough like it's no thang
New Maybach, boy that's way out of your range
All the chicks came like we at a Knicks game
Carmelo numbers, first and the fifteenth
We the best in the biz, baby there it is {Maybach Music}
I'ma handle mine, lil' homie handle his
At the Portofino just bought the top floor
I'm livin like Nino baby and want more
Now double that, Rev Run bubble bath
Overlook the city blowin out the back
She better blow my mind and she can holla back
I get better with time and that's a fuckin wrap

[Lyric]
System's got my love on lockdown
Been had him for a year or so
Baldheaded brother, heart yearns for no other
Let him go, let him go, but always a no..
As the smoke releases from the eastside that I inhale
Holdin in him in my arms, hopin that we can prevail
White man moves like snails, to get him out of jail
but I don't give a FUCK, because my mental that's his bail
Let my mind entertwine with your soul
Composed of two rows
One leading you to my heart
the other one leading you home..
Hearing those words by Faith Evans
Soon as I get home, is my heaven
Hopin you have the seed, to be planted in my garden
Never to be hardened
but to hear those cries between mother nature's thighs
They can never hold you down
King of my Crown, from the Boogie Down
Let him go, let him go, Mister Beast - let him go

[Mike Ladd]
Pacin six by six
If I'm lucky, move from twelve to twelve
At night I yells, through these bars
and all I can do is look at the stars
Waitin on the payphone that stops
No water drops, slowly gold collectin
Waitin on affection from you..
Hold these letters in sweaty palms
Watch the blood of my dream go
Waitin to hold you in my arms one more time
This life is inside out
and outside in
We all behind the crazy wild
One plantation under a noose
Got to get loose tonight, yeah
One plantation under a noose
Got to get loose tonight, yeah
One plantation under a noose
Got to get loose tonight, yeah
One plantation under a noose
Got to get loose tonight, yeah..

Lies we do despise
That's why we tell the truth, we never compromise
Lies are the root of all evil
Stop bullsh[edited], tell the truth to the people

You're lyin
You're lyin
Lies, lies

You might lie to me - I won't lie to you
Act like you don't know me, tell 'em babe, brand new
What's yours is yours - And what's mine is mine
But every time you're on the mic you're always bitin my rhyme
Tellin them stories like you're my friend
But then you go behind my back and tell a lie again
You lie to your father, you lie to your mother
You lie to your sister - Then you lie to your brother
You lie so much that the truth ain't in ya
I gotta tell a lie myself just to try to defend ya
You lie all night talkin on the phone
Tell lies in your mirror when you're home alone
You lie to the people livin next door
Cause the lady upstairs don't wanna hear it no more
You lie so much you probably think it's the truth
Must be Cinderella cause the shoe fits you

Don't lie to me
Who she think she talkin to?
Ain't nobody gon' believe that s[edited]
I know, she always comin up with some bugged out story
Yo, yo here come that lyin [edited] Righteous
Yo, what up with him?
Yo peace y'all, y'all ain't gon' shoot me no rhythm?
Haha

Lies we do despise

Lies are the root of all evil
Stop bullsh[edited], tell the truth to the people

You're lyin
You're lyin
Lies, lies

Lies people tell to conceal certain things
They say it's an act of any human being
There're small lies, big lies, bugged out and wack lies
In yo face and behind your back
There's white lies, black lies, purple and green lies
On the radio and on the TV screen
He has everyone's attention, her name he never mentions
As he tells us how he had her in disposition
It's why they have lawyers, the top chief liar
The more they lie, their fee gets higher
My girl even lies ( ? )
They even told me the ( ? ) got bigger
Should I believe they're just tryina deceive
This girl even said she was pregant by me
Always givin up her body to me and everybody
Now the father of her baby is me, [Name] and Tommy

Lies we do despise
That's why we tell the truth, we never compromise
Lies are the root of all evil
Stop bullsh[edited], tell the truth to the people

You're lyin
You're lyin
Lies, lies

Yo word, I was kickin it to that [edited]
Cause yo, I had all the girls on my tip, man
They were sweatin me, man, I needed a towel
Right, all them mutt dogs
Especially the baldheaded one with no teeth
Yo, what's up with that, Righteous?
Baldheaded with no teeth?
Y'all what's up with that, y'all know that girl was fly

Lies, lies, I'm talkin 'bout fly
That brother had it good but all he did was lie
It started as a little, there couldn't be a lot
Now he's tellin all the fellas that I'm on his jock
Knowin I just met him he wanted me to sweat him
He'll love me if I let him, if I wanted I could get him
And from the beginning he started actin ill
Said his name was Darren and I heard that it was Bill
Now it was gettin worse, he lied about his age
Told me he was 20 and ( ? )
I asked him did he smoke, he said: Nah, I never puff
Caught him with some cheeba, about to dog his stuff
I was chillin down the ave in my leather gear
I heard my homegirl yell: Yo [Name] come here
Guess who I saw around the block
Pimpin down the street imitatin the Doc
He said this girl under his arms with a big fat grin
You know he only lies sayin: We're just friends
Why should I sweat it, it's not my loss
Cause that's a girl who gives it up like the Red Cross
We walked up to her, she didn't know what to do
She just started mumblin how she's down with the crew
Her eyes got big, her mouth just dropped
Cause all the time I know she's on my [edited]'s jock
My homegirls warned me that you wasn't fly
Crawl under a rock and muthaf[edited] just die

Song:   Life (I Wonder)
Typed by: cflartey@hotmail.com

Verse 1

It was late night
The plan was cheddar, mission impossible
Meetin' with my apostles so we can spread like the gospel do
My thoughts maniacal
But at the same time, barbarian, man
We got minds like aliens but they portray us in the wrongest manner
That's why we come off like the criminals
That's why I keep close contention with my habituals
My earthly status maintains the baddest, but in beauracracy
Man, they stoppin' me from reachin' what's written in prophecies
Stoppin' me from the get-go, got me wantin' to let go
My mind's intent, though
But it took more to perfect, so
If I could, I'd have my skull encased in anemantium
The prophet said he would come last and I came right after them

Chorus (x2)

I wonder if there's an over and under beneath me
Did earth decieve me
You can listen but don't believe me
'Cause the fact of the matter
It's more chit than chatter
And before your cake blows, you gotta mix up the batter

Verse 2

We broke night
Everybody was drunk, so I spoke light
Fuck the trife, the name of this song is "Life"
I'm tellin' like tattlin', but they ain't listenin', they babblin'
Others stay battlin', while on the low the snakes is rattlin'
And water paddlin', they got me swimmin' towards infinity
Tryin' to put me under but my challas took a fit for me
Hittin' me heavily, steadily flowin' like a faucet
Gurglin' got me jumpin' over hurdles, thought I lost it, see
'Cause evil seems to be attracted to the opposite
That's why I chill with a smirk and laugh at my conglomorates

Chorus (x2)

Verse 3

At first I wrote this verse to enlighten the slumberin'
Had time to burn like lumber and livin' life had me wonderin'
All sorts of situations like facin' mental insanity
Lyrics were a plan to see
If the world could understand the three levels of lyrical lavishness
You say I'm fabulous, they say I'm fabulous
But hey, I'm just used to havin' this
So remember the name Thunder, 'cause you're gonna hear it a lot
Got more cock than a glock with more cuts than barber shops

[Hook: NOLA & (Nina Creque)]
Life has too many tears, too many fears (Well)
Too many cry, too many die (Why)
Too many weep, too many sleep while they awake
Too many claiming to be real but too many fake (Hmmm)
Everybody answer this, would you lie for your life (Uh huh)
Would you die for your life (Yeah)
Would you kill for your life (Would you)
Would you to keep it real in your life

[NOLA]
Now who's saving you if you ain't saving yourself (Well)
In the fucked up situations life's facing
I see ya pacing
Getting nervous, hard times at home a grown child
Getting no relief on mama's shoulder
Now what I advise is only cries from everybody else
Except yourself, depending on your parents, where did you inherent
All the poison thoughts
All the tears through the years fucking over peers
To get on the next niggas dick
Now how you figure life's a bitch
Life gave you life, quiet scared to hold your breath
Life gives you death, death gives you truth, truth sets you free
Yes indeed, watch as I proceed to puff the weed
And read the Vibe that's reading me
I can't trust the fake thugs, stab ya like a knife
Don't need them kind of people in my life
On the real, I hope that y'all can feel what I'm stressing
Depressed people bring depression

[Hook}

[NOLA]
It's a thin line between the real and the fake
It should be a crime if motherfuckers playa hate
Anticipate that ho shit, with that foe shit
Taking em' what you making em' that's bullshit, turn legit
Fo' I forget, where's the gat, who got my back
The one who caught my slack before they pass my crack
Like Mr. Mike chats, where your love at, huh where your love at
Now girl get that fake grin off your chin, you ain't my friend
When I was down and low, had nowhere to go you was my foe
Now all of a sudden everything is peaches and it's cream
It isn't what it seems, I see you still worried about who fucking me
I might be fucking myself, I might be fucking your daddy
Raping his pockets badly but who's to say it's your business
If I ain't told ya, for those who want to kno who this is
We be NOLA

[Hook]

[NOLA]
I can't find a way out, blackout, lights out
Why is it so dark in this motherfucking house
Why is this big bald daddy we sick such a bitch
Like I won't deny, standing outside letting the rain camouflage
The tears I cry, why does everybody wants to go to Heaven
But nobody wants to fucking die
Why they try, you didn't beat the lies
Sure to hits the skies, then you realize
Letting this person know the longest leg between your thighs
Pardon my frankness, by asking what you thanking
If you think it's all a game, then ask yourself if you fucked yourself
Or the next man, oh who this dame, I maintain
Ducked the smiles, false grinning
My conscience got me on the outside looking in
Like so-called friends, who pretend
As darling, yes y'allings, when they was calling
When I was balling but now I've falling

Album:  Chronic 2000 * Still Smokin' (Suge Knight Represents)
Song:   Like it or Not
Typed by: TeCkNeeQ@aol.com

Verse 1:

It's been a while since I seen you smile
It's been a minute since I been up in it
But who can say, the sky's the limit
I seen a pretty bad woman, made me stop and pivot
Body, hair, face, nails lookin' so exqusite
Now what is it
That a pimp who never sent the key tip to the game
Now when I jump skip, a you could find me

"I am the one, blazin'
Stayin' high, Soopafly is so amazin'
I'm your baby
The penny a what the gold weighs in
Pimpin' from black, white, Puerto Rican, and asian"

Now welcome back, now wave yor hands if your feeling that
Gettin' down, smoking a pound with the mini stack
Back up, I creep up on them till they crack up
Take my time, movin' in slow but never slack up
Baby was serving me but couldn't keep the knack up
Upset cause she was drinkin' all my yack up

"Like splittin' a blunt, for you a what you want
Women don't have to front, I bid from once a month"

Three times a find ??? with Ginuwine ability to keep it coming
Now when your butt's running I'll be there to get ya (ahhh)
I play like Kodak and get the picture
I'm all down for stickin' but I can't kick it with ya
So what's poppin', you walkin', or the boots knockin'
Yeah I hear you talking girl, but I'm only down for one option

Hook:

We can fuck around a little, gettin' down a little, roll around the town a 
little
Or we can fuck around a lot, let me hit the spot, tell me if you like it or 
not
repeat
La la, la la la la, la la la la, la la la la la
repeat

Verse 2:

I stepped in the club lookin' dippa dap
Soopafly the pimp rapper, unique with heat like the gun clapper
Comin' out the cut, from the root, and done with laughter
Quite exquisite, I make the ladies come and pay a visit

"What is it you need, baby the weed
Baby got enough to carry the feed, baby now take heed baby"

I fuck around with top notch, top ho's
Ho's with top clothes, money hungry now stop ho
Just because I walk in the club don't mean I'm spending a dub on you
This money's mine, think I'm actin' funny fine
I can lay back and sip the wine
She's down, you can tell her for real, I work for mine
You confused

"What can't you find, feelin' past your prime ??? your time away
Given the time of day"

Whoever can display the sweet smooth array
Soopafly will never pay, make 'em say hey hey hey
Get enhanced, to get to know me you take a chance
Tree by my top, leave or

"We can fuck around for a minute or two"
To get with you is like I'm
"feelin' it, dealin' it"
And later on I'm
"killin' it"

Baby told me her clit was like ice so let me chill on it
Hit that ass until it was blue, had her crip walkin'
Knocked her ass out no doubt, no more shit talkin
Who can deny that Soopafly was at your door knockin'

"Let me in"

You can even invite your friends, but this shit costs baby (costs baby)
Don't get lost baby (don't get lost baby)
I'm only here for the cash it's not for you
I wanna keep it true, like a nigga supposed to do

Hook

Verse 3:

Now would the game be different or the same
If I surcame the temptation to play a ho
Kick it in to lay a ho
What that for, hell motherfuckin' no
Give them money that's mine, hell motherfuckin' no
Ho gotta pay me to play it, let alone lay it
Just because I'm runnin' this town you picked the wrong mayor
Couldn't even get me to pitch in on a telly
Askin' from me, ha ha I broke her down like R. Kelly
 I said, no no no no no no no, no no no no no no no (everybody)
no no no no no no no, no no no no no no no
Not even cheeseburgers
no
Didn't know that Soopafly can sing, shinin' like these diamond rings
Who keeps bringing the heat
Who dropped her off in the street
Who rock it unique
Who popped the soft in the freak
Whoever it be

"Livin' in the world  ??? probably"

It's definately livin' the dream, definately you could check the means
Why I don't pay
Aint no limit to tellin what Soopafly might say (might say)

Chasing this money, I promise I'll never stop
Started from the bottom but still made it to the top

[Lil Snupe]
I finally made it out the gutter
Made a way where my momma and granny don't gotta struggle
Just to know that I did it the feeling is like no other
I'm shittin' on all you suckas, nigga ketchup like mustard
Free my nigga C4 I'm tired of seeing him suffer
Free my nigga C-Roy, somebody a undercover
I hold it down for my niggas; even though they ain't with us

my life is getting amazing, I be trippin' out daily
Where I come from it's crazy, I cry to know that I made it
Promise that I'm the hottest, I put that on my T lady
Finna kill the game, hope I hope these niggas can face it
Fuck anybody who hatin', swear that I'ma be the greatest 
and I put that shit on Coop; niggas better watch for Snupe
Refuse to rap the lies, I only can speak the truth

Empire state of mind, let's go

Things are lookin' up, I'm ready for the night
I feel good, real good, can't nobody hold me down
Gonna take advantage of all these flashin' lights
Cause it's the best time the best time for it
We can do it all right now
Can't nobody tie me down
If you want it, I got it
Tomorrow's not promised

So live inside the moment
Tell me, what are we waiting for?
What the hell are waiting for?
I wanna live inside the moment
Tell me, what are we waiting for?
What the hell are waiting for?
I wanna live inside the moment, moment
Moment
I wanna live inside the moment
I wanna live inside the moment

When I was five years old, I realized there was a road at the end
Pretty girls, cars, and big Rolls
Gold and platinum plaques, a couple million sold
Fans screamin' they love me, sellin' out my shows
I put in hard work
If you don't give your all then it won't work
Been waitin' on this day since Luscious gave me birth
Gotta believe in yourself and gotta know your worth
I did it clean as a whistle, stayed away from dirt
I told you I'ma get it
Everybody, they're talkin', I dreamt about how I'm livin'
Reality was written, I put effort in my vision
That's why I hustle so hard to be the best that ever did it

Uhh
We are slowly for surely dyin, I'm sittin back home cryin, tryin to cope
Watchin over young ones, young Gz comin up slangin ....
Livin ????? you're either dead or bein it, that's why you're locked up
but I guess hopin, black and bein a ....., ever to much to smoke
For these coppers, don't like us, the MC's they try us
Roll em up and shake em up and talk your game and see who's the tightest
and I is, messed up but it's especially the truth about my feelings
Tryin ta make millions, but ain't seen the millions, so I'm stickin the
...... dealins
Assisted, assisted the case, you missed the ...., it's feelin
Forget suckin up *?deevy?* cos you ...... need to sing it
If you're rated G, you're wit me til I D-I-E
That's why we're livin 2 die

Chorus:

Livin 2 die, gotta do my time
Livin 2 die, they ask me why do I get high
I'm livin 2 die, cos I gotta do my time
Livin 2 die, they ask me why do I get high

It was a mix-up Saturday night, walkin by, a gunshot hook up wit down the
block
Hopin the shit was a dream when I see my homey shot (Damn, man)
Whole corner blocked off
When my homey did a little dirt, that's why he got knocked off
But skip that, me and my homey go back like 8-tracks
and while I'm steady drinkin, I'm simply thinkin of that payback
No time for layback, cos it's time to go do these busters
Run thru these busters, and work out back on who dees busters
As we creep, hope we creep up right behind em
This here is weak, ain't gonna sleep until we find em
let em know, what they did, bust em straight up
They took my homey away so now I'ma take their whole click
Get matter-of-fact, I know where one of dem busters live
And it gonna be drama when we pull him out his momma's crib
Unload the gauges and the Tek 9's
These busters try to check mines, it's time they respect mines
And hit em right where it hurt
Straight chop em off in the dirt, cos only way they goin out is in a hearse
The simple fact is I don't know why
I guess the same world we was given got us livin 2 die

Chorus:

Livin 2 die, gotta do my time
Livin 2 die, they ask me why do I get high
High

Livin in fear, I know this grave shhhh, brothers are killin brothers over
stupid shhh
Over material items and ....., 40 tips
I will toss that crook or that ......, cos you'll learn
criminals earn every second, most infected by terms
Hittin their hearse can provide you better protection
Chucked out in this war, stand by the lord and take safety of a Smith &
Wessun
And stand by your door, cos your door can get kicked in
Cos it's messed up where we're livin, cause this black-on-black blastin
And it bring so much pain, but in the game, you know some days it rain
Tricks runnin their mouth, tryin to frame a brother on 'caine
It's so messed up, man, they ask me why do I stay high
Smokin on fo'-fifty-fo' flight got me livin 2 die

Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

Niggaz get locked down and always wanna make this shit look like
vacation or some shit (frontin ass niggaz) like they enjoyed theyself
Frontin ass niggaz, yo, yo, yo

Jump off the train and the first thing that I see
when I see the daylight, is a prison
I guess the government is tryin to plant negative seeds
Could it be my destiny's in the prison..
I keep awareness, cause that's where they want us
They put us in the projects, so projects become us
Don't believe me?  Peep the bars on the windows
The intercoms, why we gotta live so close?
Cops beat us up often, like C.O.'s do
Got a problem?  See the warden, when your rent is due
We got, workout spots now built on blocks
and ballcourts often watched by, housing cops
I guess the streets are the teachers, the elementaries
Then we graduate to college, get the prison degree
That's why jails are built so, close to us
Cause we never protest what's opposed to us

We went from pyramids to projects
Treated like unidentified objects
Life's a game and the devil's makin side bets
Drug us up but the seeds feel the side effects
Put our backs against the wall so we can't achieve
Pack us in so tight that we can barely breathe
Make us feel comfortable and we don't wanna leave
Throw us a bone, and no more do we feel the need
to have our own, tryin to seperate our familes and
broken homes, growin up with no identies it's - unknown
Put us back in this world, institutionalized
Not a pot to piss in, no solution arise
Out the pit evadin the rent son we was born to lose
In this world we livin in it make it hard to choose
right from wrong if doin wrong is what pays the dues
Life's a big mystery until we find the clues

They wanna us locked up (locked down)
Caged up (shut down)
Fucked up (face down)
Handcuffed (on the ground)
Shit, the plan is just to have yo' ass missin
From the womb to the tomb (from the streets to the prisons)

They wanna us locked up (locked down)
Caged up (shut down)
Fucked up (face down)
Handcuffed (on the ground)
Shit, the plan is just to have yo' ass missin
From the womb to the tomb (from the streets to the prisons)

Yo, just try and understand me
We forced to touch on what we can't see
So close, and yet so far from where we need to be
While society's promotin mental slavery
They got me followin laws that don't apply to me
Within the world, that's lovin to hate
All our negative intentions are sealin our fate
And the struggle can't wait cause the hustle is ongoin
Hell, if we ain't in it already, we all goin
Why just the other day, around the way they built another
cage for the underage inner-city brother
And it's like a life of crime is my demon, I feel haunted
with, sorry Mr. Dyer but there's no help wanted
But son gotta eat, so you know I'm back on the street
Hustlin mines, til I get back on my feet
But how many times I gotta repeat the same song?
We on the edge with no choice but to hold on

They wanna us locked up (locked down)
Caged up (shut down)
Fucked up (face down)
Handcuffed (on the ground)
Shit, the plan is just to have yo' ass missin
From the womb to the tomb (from the streets to the prisons)

They wanna us locked up (locked down)
Caged up (shut down)
Fucked up (face down)
Handcuffed (on the ground)
Shit, the plan is just to have yo' ass missin
From the womb to the tomb (from the streets to the prisons)

They wanna us locked up (locked down)
Caged up (shut down)
Fucked up (face down)
Handcuffed (on the ground)

Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

	Is there anyone close.. by.. who can listen to this?
	And who can see it.. plain as day
	Look how it FALLS down
	Falls down upon everybody!
	This is it

[Lateef]
Looking, over a city, that's gritty, and rather pretty
A pity, it's hard to find, but inequity, cover
every itty bitty square diamond of jiggy
They givin ??, up to woodsy
manipulatin they minds in the alleyways
These dizzy and shitty rats, the sizes of kitty-kats
They cross paths when traffic subsides; somewhere
some brothers is overstandin on a hot black rooftop
Freestylin for they GOT damn lives, the spirit, it gets live
and answers the question why God blessed the Earth
But, buildings block out the sky, and the children
are oversexualized, media-wise, brutalized by parents
at the tender age of five, in front of they siblings wide-eyed
Nah not surprised, just the real scene regularly
Up in between the lies, try to put it together GET
they pieces of the pie, hope they clever and tough
Make it better before they die, plant the next seeds
somewhere in the South Bronx, or Patterson ??
The baddest with sharp chomp, to splatter when mouths-off
Retali' and swear he could damage em Dunn
but that will shatter his Mom's faith
in the art that she burns, herbs and candles of perm'
It's hard to call it see cause times change and the world turn
Some end up slangin dope, some end up strung out
on coke and sherm, some party every night for the rest of they life
and some learn, go corporate all professional rhetoric
with sensational glory, let me tell you all one day
that it is it ain't boring, and so hard to ignore it
Cause any day in this fork, that they callin New York
Based on nothin but currents, you can find yourself a failure
or a success story
On the subway, at three in the mornin, huh
Or on the corner, or up on a rooftop yawnin
Meditatin upon it, lookin over a city that's gritty
and rather pretty, a pity
It's hard to find but inequity covers every itty bitty
square diamond, the engine, of America, inchin
toward hysteria, pimpin, every fate

[El-P]
My friends are the faces you sit on, lickin a profit popsic'
where food is just a necessity between sitcom watchin
Soak up quick image instead of black marks on papyrus
fabric logic, where true to dirt perps go incogninant
Think of Soup Nazi, empatzi project hard copy
Books will suffer Farenheits, quality of life flesh sliced
Omega daylight quota, pop luck lottery info
GigaPet rapist, internet pedophile disco
Sensationalist function of truth, dirty ass fetish
Glass bubble lo-cal profile, the year's fiscal
Workin family, Social Jowe, boot camp
Rehab group home kid, idolized cartoon missile
Mostly, lonely, plant life
Cement arena scream when you don't listen closely
Switchblade amaze young gun Brooklyn blood transplant
immature Menendez fashion
Crystal Method lover, buy the bottle, jungle captive
where MC's got little cocks on teeth with fillings out like magnets
Caught up in the dragnet, tri-felon
Shoula packed a plastic handheld lead shark repellant
I sense the tension building, since canvas killing
K-9's roam trained our district
Culture murder politic sadistic
Policy ?? backtrack, caught up in a tune from rockin fat cap
I told him it was art but just got laughed at
Burner liquid concoction on hot celsius
and kelpachlorics for the fatal facial, spray deface you
Sooner than never, most lawless progress together
Fuck the bullshit, I react to acid flux product definitive junk
brain rape train bottle burners or books, FUCK THAT!

[Lyrics Born]
Imagine this, Angeles, or San Francisco
And everybody sandwiched in, can't stop here and ambulences
don't nobody ass-kiss, ain't practical bein passive
in the city you ask so much ass and mo' asses
It's a batch of latin girl, actin rappin off the spanish
english quest, can't understand, as the languages clash
And every ad is vandalism, the trash gets aneurysms
It's delegates and panelists all representin they nationalism
and the battle inches on, every section seperated
by eth-nic features decorated veterans deliverin
les-sons to the younger people stoops that double as bleachers
And I'm part, of an elite fleet, of MC's, and Truthspeakers
I import, concrete beats, that just speak, when my moods flavor
My peers I beg forgiveness, I just don't buy twelve inches
Too many independents, they share the same resemblence
Too hard to make decisions, I built up a resistance
like I'm fightin off a sickness plus they just don't hold my interest
but, missionin out, to the indigineous birthplace
The first day, I inched below the sur-face
and found, inspiration, in surplus, in my, in-terpretation
of disturbed crazy world, of love, dope shit, attemptin contemplation on
Uniquely woven and continously flowin intricately sewn into
the fabric of the nation New York City keep on mowin em down baby!

Album:  Eastern Conference All Stars II
Song:   Look Into My Eyes
Typed by: bootleg210@msn.com

[Defari]
Yeah, this ain't no funny style rap (no way)
with the lights and neon
This that real shit with Mighty Mi, and my nigga Mr. Eon
And they came all the way to L.A. for this one
Eastern Conference All-Stars boy
Yeah, ha-ha, so check it out...

[Verse 1]
I cherish good word in the scripture
Just like the frozen moments in every picture
No less than a hundred percent, that's what I give-ta
And on any quest to be the best in my center
Scarin a regime that lasted for many years
Wash 'em down like Crown and beers, cheers
Here's a toast to a new westcoast brigadere
They hate from a distance but then smile when they near
Really in fear - I wanna make this landmark with my trademark
Beam my shinin light on all those who stay dark
In the mind, searchin, seekin you'll find
what's been right, in front of your face all the time
For example; I grew up in a city of scandal
I knew that nothin was iller than the drum and piano
The commando, bada la sio de la Los Angel
With Xzibit I told you that my +Business+ I gotta +Handle+
So I gamble, I rap for my mighty old camel
With a touch of elequence like a mahogany panel
Wood grain, every line I feed the brain food
Pick or choose the degree'll abuse, while the noose'll loose

[Hook - 2X]
So when you look into my eyes, you won't see no funny guy
Just a serious side, that can't no money buy
When you look into my eyes and you see my physi-cal
You'll see maximum dedication to the men-tal

[Verse 2]
So when you look into my eyes, you won't see mini-mal
Some brothers is righteous, some crimi-nal, what is it now?
Do we all stand up the same?
Do we all fare equal in this life of game?
I don't think so, the color of the skin makes one unequal
And what is now was once then, divided people
No justice, when a cop prejudges
How many cops dump glocks when a man just budges?
The budgets, are bigger with devils than in the ghettos
Senior citizens blowin their checks at the Meadows
On the three horse, a pint of Jack
Skip a three-course meal, and wash away the pain he feel
Imagine going to war for a country, and when ya get back
you can't work (what?) for none of they companies
They try to chump me, loan sharks are feedin me money
I'm so hungry, the American Dream, it ain't that lovely

[Hook: 2X]

{*scratched sample*} 2X
"Look.. into my eyes and..."
   "...all you see..."    <--- Mr. Eon

[Verse 3]
Cuz if I could, I'd give ten meals to every hood
Make sure the children eat well and live good
Make sure the mothers and the fathers got figures
So they don't have to smoke away the pain or drink the liquor
I'm a brand new nigga in this matrix game
And incase you didn't know, revolution mean change
So I'ma change what I can for the grown man
Tell the world I feed my family with my own hands
Let 'em know oh fo' sho' that nigga Herut pro
Fuckin up ya brain, like the whitest of blow
On the go, I gotta reach all my goals
And word to M.O.P. like +Ice+ I'm straight +Cold+ nigga

Song:   Let Me Tell You Something
Typed by: Lil Hustle

(*talking*)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Let me tell you something (let me tell you)
About life in these streets (yeah, yeah) yeah

[Hook]
Let me tell you something
About life, in the streets
Let me tell you something
Trying to make, ends meet
Let me tell you something
With no shoes on your feet
Let me tell you something

[Ronnie Spencer]
Now I know, what brothers be talking about
On the streets, enough to make you scream and shout
I can look deep, into my brother's eyes
And see his life, is so full of lies
What's the game, what's the plan
Who's to say, what makes a man
What's a constant struggle, mind blowing decisions
Mistakes been made, they got my brother in prison

(Bridge)
It's your son, that you're missing
It's the cycle, it's the system
That hurt his father, now his son
Now there's something, got to be done

[Hook]

[Ronnie Spencer]
It's a shame, what a man's got to do
To keep a family fed, in a descent roof
They spend a billion dollars
Sending a man, to Mars
In a world of ghettos, where our children starve
Brothers hustle, trying to go legit
But when things get hard, he tend to forget
Putting dope in his draws, trying to avoid the laws
Just to feed his family y'all
What's the game, what's the plan
Who's to say, what makes a man
It's a constant struggle, mind blowing decisions
Mistakes been made, they got my brother in prison

(Bridge)
It's your son, that you're missing
It's the cycle, it's the system
That hurt his father, now his son
Now there's something, got to be done

[Hook]

[Ronnie Spencer]
When things go wrong, what do we do
Break down on our knees, you know where we go to
Jesus Christ, you know we need ya
What's the game, what's the plan
Who's to say, what makes a man
Let me tell you something

Ooooh, tell you
Trying to make it

Album:  No More Prisons
Song:   Lunchbreak
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Helixx]
Have you ever felt like you were just a modern day slave?
Livin in a life worth livin only some of the days?
Workin hard nights, hard stripes from all types
No rights but pardons, we live within the system starvin
It's determined how they show us lookin like we live in luxury
The struggle's been forgotten, while we stay in misery
This fucks with me, like I'm doin nothin when the trouble seen
I pay the cost to lose my life to see forever's glean
Dream a little dream and hope we'll make it somehow
Need to take all our resources, and join forces
The cause is not the fault cause we don't try and reprimand it
We define the dotted line, so FUCK these niggaz speakin slander

[Pri]
I start my verse by sayin FUCK Guilani
And if you got a problem kid, you know just where to find me
I'm tired of this shit, cause each and every single day
I kneel down and I pray and then I wish, to a false God
that forgot that I exist -- then again, fuck the world
The whole world's tellin lies, never had anything to happen
to make me ever feel otherwise -- cause everyone that I know
has tried to run me through the dirt
Which makes my life more complicated than transexuals givin birth
So don't you step in Pri way, unless it be your D-Day
That time of the month, sex backed up, and I ain't ate in three days
That's right - I'm up here bitchin
And I'ma keep on gettin louder until somebody out there listens
with no pot to piss in

[Helixx]
Four score and twenty years upon this earth
I seen the lurchin 'cross the surface from the politicians
The American school system
Plead resistance from my prison sentence
Wanted to shackle up my thoughts and said I needed penance
A false avengance

[Pri]
I see million dollar rap videos
Showin me what I be missin but nobody takes that money
to start an educational system - we need to build our own schools
without no hesitation -- FUCK the board of education

[Helixx]
I expose the untold and draw it out in paragraphs type bold
or, maybe lay it on the line then build a boat
Like plastic gold, it's always rotten and
after facts are forgotten it's
you were wondering who unleashed the plot that's quite monotonous

[Pri]
Conspiracies of a thousand different ghettoes
which wouldn't be so bad if the roaches weren't used
and immune to Black Flag, females livin trife kid
Don't see how you bother, chickenheads be havin babies
just to have a baby's father, coupons in effect-ah
Food stamps they be doubled if you look inside my cabinets
they look like crossword puzzles, but for now I'm pullin hours kid
Just waitin for the day, that I can shout out KISS MY ASS
in a disrespectful way..

* send corrections to the typist

Lovesick like a dog with canine sensitivity
Developing this new theory of relativity
Connecting our souls resting in captivity
Positive life sacrifice what it is to me
Our history, only a quarter of a century
Reality, sitting on the shoulders of our chemistry
See ain't no mystery, the colours that we mix will set the mind free
Let the blind see beyond harmony!
Breathe life into dead space blow away clouds of doubt
New territory we determine to be
Everything a safe heaven is supposed to be
Now it might seem distant but the time is near
When our thoughts take off and split the atmosphere
Pure sound wave travel semi-infinitely
Plus I'll see you there utmost definitely

[Hook]
'cause the beat plus the melody
Makes me speak of L.O.V.E eloquently so evidently

Good gracious, every process has a genesis and ends with a revelation
God bless this opportunity for me to find a voice
For some words that have waited for way too long
Low wages, Small tips on the avenue
Haven't you heard the news lately?
Seems we've been living for sometimes in a purgatory
But yo, I thought I knew what a love song sound like
But I felt a warmer tune in the sunlight
I could still hear it in the room past midnight
Gotta move, take a solo cruise in the moon light
Sometimes I do forget, Oh how much we could ease the lives we lead
If we learn to let go, the reins that we hold
Return to our souls, and the spirit let flow
So you see, upon everyday faces there's a million shades to
Express definition of grace
But the method I choose me perrogative
There's so much love in me I got to give.

[Hook]
'cause the beat plus the melody
Makes me speak of L.O.V.E eloquently so evidently

Oh how I could write a book on how you make me feel
But how about this song that I wrote for you?
What I feel like...I wanna put my trusts in these simple words
For you to feel what I'm saying, what you feel like?
Reminisce about the little episodes that we shared together
Remember the time that you told me
In the cold night, to relax when all I knew was to hold tight
Remember the time that I spoke to the crowd in a full house and
Realizes that you was my ace?
I was the joker on the stage singing the blues
All eyes on me and had nothing to prove
But yo, I thought I knew what a diamond shine like
But I felf a sharper love in the limelite
From the queen of hearts watching me quitely in the upper deck balcony
Sometimes I do suspect, I'm a actor in a well-scripted live divine comedy
When I look back at the frozen slice of time and try to defrost the feeling lost
Now enough with the metaphors, the motivation that I wrote this letter for
For you to know that the music held us carry on
Like you say a new day will bring us tomorrow...

[Hook]
'cause the beat plus the melody
Makes me speak of L.O.V.E eloquently so evidently

Uhh uhh uhh uhh
While you smoke the lye (Shit uhh uhh)
I drink the brew (JaySon, Ed O.G. check it out)
You smoke the lye

[Big Juan]
Growin up didn't know enough, now I got the touch
Gettin sick on the mic like a nigga throwin up
Blowin up, while you holdin up, Juan roll it up
JaySon, Ed O.G., hate to see ya showin up
While it's hard for you to retail, I post like bail
on you, slept on, while you set traps we set sales
Bunker Hill compared to Yale ugh

[JaySon]
JaySon steal the mic, feelin it like a diddler
Rooftop ghetto fiddler, ill rhyme, riddler
Lyrical big pen, scribbler
In the middle of your cortex through your gortex
It stinks like raw sex, full page, in The Source
Next Porsche, Lex, baguettes, more fade than solarflex
Drunken style gotcha, stumblin
Mumblin, snap the ball, watch em fumblin
like Herschelle, ugly like Whoopie up in The Color Purple
We form connects while you're in the wrong circle

[Ed O.G.]
Ed's puttin heads to bed like a Sealy
and clown on MCs like Barnham & Baily
Run around the planet like a comet named Halley's
B-52, Irish Cream Kahlua's and Baileys
Blowin up like a bomb on a Muslim to Israeli's, gettin jacked like Hailey
You burn me? Eh eh. eh eh, really?!?
Denis like Leary, fist em like Fury
Hot like curry, reppin Rocks Very
It'll burn any Joe like Torre, so don't worry
End of the story, we blunt like Cory

	Ugh, ugh, ugh
	Mad love right here, murder pen Rocks Very
	Death jester all year, got love for this
	Who's comin with hits? Representin Bost-on
	Ed O.G., JaySon, G-Squared, Big Juan

[Big Juan]
Falling down like James Brown with the cape around my head
Lead me off the stage warm, gon' rap til he dead
I'm face red from the out-of-breath line I said
What we do to this get him open like a uterus in bed
True to this, my symphony'll get the gluteus
from the bootiest chicken to the Maybelline snootiest
Aim right, the same night, if your game tight on all floors (What?)
Like Tela Rock warns "It's Yours", ugh what? Ugh

[Ed O.G.]
Ed O.G. started rollin with God and stopped rollin with gats
Witta pack of wild D.O.G.S. never fuckin with cats
JaySon and Juan though, between us
over a billion served like McDonald's, drunken high like sopranos
The stereo or on mono, we tell all
like the Bull Grivano, hit this, I hit the bottle
Got your mind in a boggle, you want us to fall
Wishin and hopin like Chicago but we play as we ball

[JaySon]
We date rape tapes like Cape Fear, sedate like Rufi's
Mickey's wakin and stickin, molestin mics
Ain't nothin pretty or bitchy, we bruise tracks just like hickeys
You want JaySon, Ed O.G., Big Juan
The connect tricky like magicians
Pussy technicians, sado-masochistic
Positions, it gets better, to the letter
K period forever

	Ugh
	Mad love right here, murder pen Rocks Very
	Death jester all year, got love for this
	Who's comin with hits? Representin Bost-on
	Ed O.G., JaySon, G-Squared, Big Juan

[Ed O.G.]
I break MC cyphers like rep's Mos def
We leave none left plus we hot like breath
Don't ask why like Clef, or get trapped like chess
To all you gangsta rappers I'm like Elliot Ness
Yo, get bag like a duney, from Dusk Til Dawn like George Clooney
Findin wack rappers in the booney's
I shine like the sun while you dark and gloomy
My shit be air-tight while your shit be roomy
You can act bugged, wit you drugs or your thugs
But we on some real shit, no ordinary love

[JaySon]
You hate us like Dominicans and Puerto Ricans
Freak more styles than Adina, servin niggas like court subpoena's
Who be the Treacherous Three?
Not Sunshine, Special K and Moe Dee
but JaySon, Big Juan, Ed O.G., check check out the melody
Tellin me stealin beats should be, a felony
If you playin niggas, not payin niggas
It's like Deep Jack and legendary niggas
and payin em ordinary figures

[Big Juan]
This ain't no ordinary love y'all, this ain't no ordinary love uhh
I show my ass like kids with A.D.D.
'83 told em ball, not all your soul's quotable
Big Juan like glass shots, empty em
G-Squared simpty em, from task cams to Pentium
Name anonymous, sex game mynogamous
Throughout this metropolis have em cummin like the apocalypse
Shakin like a Motorola, I'm a gene-ral
You just a soldier, Juan Gotti, connect like cosa nostra

[G Squared scratches]

Too, full-too full of carbohydrates, to flow my rate
I shake-rate vi-light-brate, light-making, make late migrate
Plant seed and let it germinate, vermin I terminate
Verbally I offend more *niggaz* that the Mark Fuhrman tapes
I burn this great when I get busy, the crowd ask what is he
Human or robot, my flow's hot, those that know not
must be dizzy, so, how many fingers do you see
You goin up one, what, two, uh, three cause I knocked your ass silly
Of course I'm livin Big but who the hell is Willie?
Try to peel me, and I'll put you on the floor quicker than Tyson did McNeely

Aiyyo, once you hear the Capital A, rappers stay
Went through for a while son, it won't go away
Composin dramatical plays, Element Natural ways
Control your thoughts like, sniffin crazy thoughts, four-oh quarts
Stay dipped, in Polo Sport menswear
A-Butta be the one you and your friends fear
Natural E, we droppin gems here
Shinin for ten years, and keep writin until my pen-pen gets
gets ink upon the paper, rhymin the flavor-flavor
Too high-too higher than a skyscraper, my blades-blades
deacon-deacon, my thoughts connectin like, when my beeper's beepin
You stay sleepin, A's creepin, I'm makin mics parade-parade
New jack new jack when... the mess
While you procrastinate, I graduate, past your rate
You see my flow'll fascinate, Natural E, we collaborate
Check it cause rap is great, Wiz, scratch it up like cissy fights
Butta, forever shine like, New York city lights

	Keep risin to the top
	No one can stop we
	Natural Elements
	We'll forever S-H-I-N-E
	(repeat 2X)

Yo, physically I bring the pain here, for shorties wet like rain gear
I hit you buck fifty, like New York city train fare
Yo eryday I rock the same gear, cause money low, I bag a honey doe
This one go out to all my sunny bros, in N-Y-C
Northeast Bronx, my territory
You confess to a priest, writing lyrics is better for me
Never sweat a shorty, now I'm broke, got no sort of hope
But in the future, when I got money, I'll be adorable
But shorty played herself, like brothers on the train, usin a portable telly
Cause both of y'all look the same, like Aaron Hall and R. Kelly
I bust a shot like Marbury, battle?
You must be sniffin somethin like, Darryl Strawberry
Check what I get nice with, my right hand is what I grip a mic with
In the future, I circle numbers on this Lex priceless, but yo
Me gettin burnt or hurt, won't be tolerated
I got rhymes up the UHHHHHH, forget it I'm constipated

See these lines be like graffiti burners, Essence tags your mental hall
as I come bust aerosol meets flame, into your face with no shame
Rappers be talkin like they rich when they be ridin the train
And when they flow you know it all sound the same
Repetitive like escalators, plus sweeter than Now and Laters
Your clout about as much weight as a sheet of paper
You have no flavor, pullin my saber, removin you
from the agenda wannabe pretenders Fall like September through November
Get open end to then, verbally dismembered
Remember Essence flows, I'm treatin you like Mendel
From Bolo, to get dough, see the mic you need to let go
Your high-low, you can't rip it with expertise
Please, this MC, put simply is a G-O-double-D-E-double-S
You cannot contest

	Keep rising to the top
	No one can stop we
	Natural Elements
	We'll forever S-H-I-N-E

[Intro: Prodigy]
You know, ever since I could remember I wanted to be a gangsta
Them real gangstas that is, them Mobb niggaz
Them killers that moved in silence, them round table niggas
But when I think back, them gangstas around my way
There was this one nigga that went by the name of...

[Godfather Pt. III]
The God motherfuckers get scarred with no bars
Hold animal niggas that go to war with a vengeance
All you gotta do is mention the click, and that's that
Reconstruct your whole thought, with bloodsport force
All y'all off course niggas get shook back in place
I pop heavy, we Rock Steady, shots to your face
From a place where I was thought always hold mine, so I'ma hold this
We the Infamous, continous hits
of nothin but that raw street, ghetto shit
Pah, we kill dogs to the death, lay niggas to rest
Drink Henny cold best, fuck bein the best
I peel through chest, 'till I see your flesh
Eat your heart, and spit it out, I could give a fuck less
Get stuck up in some shit, that you know you gon' regret
Motherfucker!

	"We be the Infamous" -> Prodigy (repeats throughout interlude)

[Interlude: Prodigy]
This some crazy shit
Yeah that's right, you know
We talkin that real criminal shit
YouknowwhatI'msayin?
Niggas like that is hard to come by
They don't make niggas like that everyday man
And now that I'm thinkin, I can remember this other nigga
Aiyyo, this is a gangsta, this is a real gangsta nigga right here

[Prodigy]
Bandana P, Banana Clip P
E'rybody move back, it's 'bout to get ugly
They try and shit on me like I ain't a made nigga
I ain't gotta send soldiers, I hit niggas
Bang your head off, big respect like the name Xerox
Run bitch, I'm airin out your blid-ock
Niggas get shot fuckin with me, of course
You a rap nigga, I'm a crime boss
I'm a full bread, full-fledged Mobb nigga
I Pledge alliegance to my Infamous flag, niggas get tagged
and bagged, for comin at my familia
This ain't the Roc nigga, we ain't them faggot ass niggas
It's just that gangsta shit, from the world's most dangerous click
that walk any pavement, I do what the fuck I feel, 
say what the fuck I want
These niggas be bitin' they tongue

	"We be the Infamous" -> Prodigy (repeat to fade)

[Coyote]
Mama, because I love you
Hello?
Mom, it's me
I miss you, moms
Mama, because I love you
Man, are you looking through the albums again?
Those were the good days, moms

[Chorus: Coyote]
Mama's gonna laugh and smile
Mama's gonna sometimes cry (Sometimes cry)
Mama gonna be by your side (Mama, because I love you)
Mama be there right by your side (Right by your side)

[Repeat Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Mama made my clothes, way back, when I was little
Mama made me eat all my food, I cried a little
Mama used to tell me, "Don't give up, you'll regret it"
Mama used to tell me, "That's your goal, don't forget it"
Mama made me get up
"Go on, get up to it"
Mama made me cry when I was wrong, and I knew it
Mom, we've had some good times and we can all remember (Mama, because I love you)
Mama took the whip out, sometimes, I remember
Mama raised a family
Mama made it better
Mama, that's mama
How could you forget her?
Mama's gon' cry when grandma goes to heaven (Mama, because I love you)
Mama's gon' pray so that grandma gets to heaven
Mama hooks it up, camarones con nopales
Mama, you're the bomb, come Christmas, tamales
Mama, you're the bomb, you're the bomb, and I love you
And this one's for you
Dedicated, cause I love you

[Chorus] - 2X

[Verse 2]
Mama went to school on my first day of school
Mama, check it out
Yeah, you raised no fool
Mama made it possible
Mama made it happen
Mama told it how it was, mama's fingers kept snappin'
Mama's older now, but she's still full of life
Mama's still the boss, and that title's good for life
Mama told me once, "Chase a dream, make it happen" (Mama, because I love you)
So now, I break it down, put it down, keep ya clappin'
Mama's sad now, mama cries through the night
Mama says, "Grandma's glowing in her twilight"
Mama, tell you what, "Yeah, I'm right by your side" (Mama, because I love you)
Yeah, I'm feelin' what you're feelin', only God can decide
Grandma told me once, "Family love is eternal"
So I'm a believe
Grandma's soul is eternal
Mama, don't you worry now, you know that we love you
Mama, that's my moms
Mom, cause I love you

[Chorus] - 2X

[Verse 3]
I remember way back, since way back, mom
Wanna tell you that I love you, ma, love you, love you, ma
Yeah, life ain't always happy, but we smile on, mom
One day at a time
"Breathing life with the smile on"
You told me that once
And I quote you everyday
Everyday, we pray
Pray we make it through the day
I see my babies play, life changing everyday (Mama, because I love you)
And we can't stop that
And all's we got is us
So we smile on, facing life, hoping for the best
And that's the truth, ma, yeah, I'm coming with the truth
I wish we'd never cry, mama, hate to see ya cry (Mama, because I love you)
Mama, don't you worry, grandma lives on inside of us
Pass life to all of us
Gave life to all of us
Talkin' generations, so here's a thanks from all of us
Love ya, love ya, simply sayin', you're the bomb
Mama, you're the bomb, so I'm singing you this song

Song:   The Things Your Man Won't Do
Typed by: TwstdFlava@aol.com

1 -    It's 1999 and it's scandalous
       Only in God do I trust
       Stay ready to bust the closest one to you
       These are the things you think your man won't do

Everybody told me to peep game because this
Sorry motha-fucka done got me into some shit
He got me bent
But I shoulda known since the first time that I saw the both of you
Sittin' in the living room
Lookin' like Jennifer 2 was on the menu
But your destiny baby, and reality was headed for doom
What happened to the animalistic passion and thuggish
Way we used to bone even when we wasn't alone (like dat)
In every category, I listed you a pro
But now I know, but you don't know that I know you'se a ho
This is a nigga I took trips and hustled wit
My roll dawg, we was on some soulmate shit
The type of shit that make a man want just me
I let you feel my soul when I opened up and let you in me
But you on some other shit, ain't that right boo?
I'm seconds away from makin' you feel my 4-4 slug, ooohh

   Heyyyyy
   Come on!
   Come on!

Repeat 1

Now it might be ironic
But somebody been playin' on the phone
And every day it happened, at night you leave home
Where you been? 
Who da hell you gotta meet in the middle of the night?
What you mean "what I'm talkin' 'bout?" I got hind-sight
My homie called me and told me he got the tightest sticky
So I got a few elbows, so I could flip it
We shot the shit
And then we attempted to put some shit on my mind 
About you that made me trip
You, around me, sneakin', playin' freaky deeky
And the busta you was with ain't actin' like they cool wit me
Went to school wit me
Now you can't look me in my eyes
A little boy tryin' to be a man, hidin' behind lies
You, the masta, ain't got me ???
Got a free ride in my trunk, punk
Why do you do the things you do?
That ain't the half if it, because this busta is a man just like you

   Heyyyyy
   Come on!
   Come on!

Repeat 1

I shouldn't be surprised 'cause it be the hardest bustas
The drive-by, shoot 'em up, bang bang bustas
Chocolate boss, slidin' in and out the butt bustas
Don't stutter, I say one word right now
I shoulda listened to my homies 
That told me about you hauntin, maybe
This explains the fuckin' shit stains
Not only in the back, but in the front of your Range
OH GOD, you must be testin' me, to see 
If I'm gon' be the old me or the new G
Saw you at the resturaunt exchangin' fuck faces
So stay your ass and twisted right over these lyricists
I can start all over just like the book of Genesis
And DON'T touch me, 'cause I don't know where your ass been
It ain't my fault you let your homeboy run up in it
I can't imagine you fuckin' wit KY Jelly
Best believe you gon' pay for what you did to me
   
   Heyyyyy
   Come on!
   Come on!

Who rocks who rocks unorthodox 
Methods to wreck it so expect shit to get hectic 
>From my direct hit 
The fly hits bullseye respect it 
I don't do cheap tricks to get chicks 
I just stand by my word (word) full attention 
And still get attention 
And still it should be noted 
They all folded from me and potent quote yeah

We rock words unorthodox awkward

Hey you gotta get it together or leave it alone
You gotta lead the way or be the clone
Stand there before the world holdin' microphones 
You gotta freak what ya feel cause to each is own
Don't like what I kick you can't see my zone
I'm from deeper galaxies than regions unknown 
And my legion is grown in amazin' ways 
Preparing for these crazy days hey

Hook:
"What an expression you are manifested"
Manifested

Verse 2:
My brain's on lock like two hungry pits in an alley fightin' over T-bone
Shit is fowl like cheap cologne
On your Uncle's Sundays shoes straight from Penny's 
Pob's droppin' math while we sip on Henny
I hate it when my pockets on skinny
But shit happens 
If you don't stay on top 
Tryin' to bubble not pop

You must of spread yourself to make life instramental

To keep things from gettin' worse 
When some player hater get what's all peace (it's all peace) 
Been gamin' waitin' operatin' do it all team 
Needin' to be condemned by a government agency 
Mad at the way them niggas and hoes thought they was playin' me

Yeah I usually give niggas the benefit of the doubt 
Thinkin' that eventually they come arrrrround
? from jumps who thought it would pump? 
Now we over the hump tryin' to get skrilla like Trump

Never been a chump
Show my ass like Gump
Use to dream about the hump 
Tryin' to get my pockets to lump 
Like cancer in titties
Spread through cities 
I'm smooth with mine like pimps roll Kiddies (eeeeeeer)

[INTRO]
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

[FIRST VERSE]
Broken glass everywhere
People pissin' on the stairs, you know they just don't care
I can't take the smell, can't take the noise
Got no money to move out, I guess I got no choice
Rats in the front room, roaches in the back
Junkies in the alley with a baseball bat
I tried to get away but I couldn't get far
'cuz a man with a tow truck repossessed my car

[CHORUS]
Don't push me 'cuz I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head
Uh huh ha ha ha

It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

[SECOND VERSE]
Standin' on the front stoop hangin' out the window
Watchin' all the cars go by, roarin' as the breezes blow
Crazy lady, livin' in a bag
Eatin' outta garbage pails, used to be a fag hag
Said she'll dance the tango, skip the light fandango
A Zircon princess seemed to lost her senses
Down at the peep show watchin' all the creeps
So she can tell her stories to the girls back home
She went to the city and got so so seditty
She had to get a pimp, she couldn't make it on her own

[CHORUS]
Don't push me 'cuz I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head
Uh huh ha ha ha

It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

[THIRD VERSE]
My brother's doin' bad, stole my mother's TV
Says she watches too much, it's just not healthy
"All My Children" in the daytime, "Dallas" at night
Can't even see the game or the Sugar Ray fight
The bill collectors, they ring my phone
and scare my wife when I'm not home
Got a bum education, double-digit inflation
Can't take the train to the job, there's a strike at the station
Neon King Kong standin' on my back
Can't stop to turn around, broke my sacroiliac
A mid-range migraine, cancered membrane
Sometimes I think I'm goin' insane
I swear I might hijack a plane!

[CHORUS]
Don't push me 'cuz I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head

It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

[FOURTH VERSE]
My son said, Daddy, I don't wanna go to school
'cuz the teacher's a jerk, he must think I'm a fool
And all the kids smoke reefer, I think it'd be cheaper
if I just got a job, learned to be a street sweeper
Or dance to the beat, shuffle my feet
Wear a shirt and tie and run with the creeps
'cuz it's all about money, ain't a damn thing funny
You got to have a con in this land of milk and honey
They pushed that girl in front of the train
Took her to the doctor, sewed her arm on again
Stabbed that man right in his heart
Gave him a transplant for a brand new start
I can't walk through the park 'cuz it's crazy after dark
Keep my hand on my gun 'cuz they got me on the run
I feel like a outlaw, broke my last glass jaw
Hear them say "You want some more?"
Livin' on a see-saw

[CHORUS]
Don't push me 'cuz I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head
Say what?

It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

[FIFTH VERSE]
A child is born with no state of mind
Blind to the ways of mankind
God is smilin' on you but he's frownin' too
Because only God knows what you'll go through
You'll grow in the ghetto livin' second-rate
And your eyes will sing a song called deep hate
The places you play and where you stay
Looks like one great big alleyway
You'll admire all the number-book takers
Thugs, pimps and pushers and the big money-makers
Drivin' big cars, spendin' twenties and tens
And you'll wanna grow up to be just like them, huh
Smugglers, scramblers, burglars, gamblers
Pickpocket peddlers, even panhandlers
You say I'm cool, huh, I'm no fool
But then you wind up droppin' outta high school
Now you're unemployed, all non-void
Walkin' round like you're Pretty Boy Floyd
Turned stick-up kid, but look what you done did
Got sent up for a eight-year bid
Now your manhood is took and you're a Maytag
Spend the next two years as a undercover fag
Bein' used and abused to serve like hell
'til one day, you was found hung dead in the cell
It was plain to see that your life was lost
You was cold and your body swung back and forth
But now your eyes sing the sad, sad song
Of how you lived so fast and died so young so...

[CHORUS]
Don't push me 'cuz I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head
Uh huh huh huh huh

It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under
Huh, uh huh huh huh huh

It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under
Huh, uh huh huh huh huh

[Ghostface Killah]
Yo, with this game come alotta hate, but there's alotta snakes
Niggaz see the size of my dish, and wanna pick a plate
Thinkin' I'ma fold under pressure, y'all wanna see me break
Had these niggaz skating on ice, doing a figure eight
Twelve getting strong in the game, y'all can't touch me
I must be, made out of steel, y'all can't crush me
Watch how I paint this picture, into a mixture
With symbolic words, when they merge they form a scripture
Tone be that nigga, I belong in the ficture
Very necessary that my robes is furry
Picture me, in the King's chair blowin' on bark
Before queens holding toothbrushes, scrubbin' my Clarks
Feedin' me grapes, give me style shakes, Frosted Flakes
Flood the plate, twenty four karats that intake
I'm all over the globe, like water in moat
Cocaine cookouts over portable stoves

[Chorus: Ghostface Killah]
Watch how we milk 'em this year
Ya'll niggaz straight soft, like silk in this here
My niggaz came off, ran hard for 10 years
But this time around, we got a new sound for deaf ears
Things is different, now time's is changing
So it's a new direction that my rhymes is aimed in
It's more than entertainment, it's hip hop
The way that we walk, the way that we talk
It's our language

[Trife Da God]
Aiyo, now who you know is more liver than Trife?
The piledriver improviser go to work on your body like exercisers
My opening lines'll open your mind
Glock popper, clock stopper, leave you frozen in time
Plus you never seen me rolling with shines, I'm barely seen
Got bitches in all flavors, I call 'em my Dairy Queens
Gettin' CREAM, that's a daily routine, y'all niggaz know me
I'm the one and only, that's word to Chef and Pretty Toney
Make my debut on Bulletproof Wallets, that's when I come through
Stay true, got nothing for free, I had to pay dues
You feelin' like a frog then jump, you in the swamp with gators
Nigga, we eat you tadpoles for lunch
It's not a hunch, it's a sure fact
Drunk nigga fall back, I'm tellin' you once
Don't get your fronts and your jaw cracked
Theodore, we the new villains in here
Starks Enterprise, we seeing 20 million this year

[Chorus]

[Myone]
In these war times, whose the enemy?
I'm something like Matt Damon, and backin' in my Bourne Supremacy
I was brought to bring forth the remedy
Deadly ready or not, y'all people better steady the block
Or keep the heat coming, steady or not
Don't want no trouble with Joe
We'll throw blows that empty out the whole bungaloo
If y'all soldiers can handle my click
Then walk forward and find the one that make you ceist to exist
You never heard me spit as lethal as this
Flippin' ya brother man, on the other hand will empty a clip
If I build, my life hangs in a myst, the balance we call this
Dark and light, I know wrong from right
But am I wrong if I live my animal appetite
Have a feast in the middle of night, riddle me right
And more righteous, must of all your might, you can't bite this
Cause the man in your mirror is my lightness, and know that act is right

Typed by: davpaul@dove.net.au


Woke up out of bed this mornin at 5, face the light
Downstairs in the kitchen, 'erb tea, made a pot
Now I'm sippin, enjoyin the best peppermint
when I heard a sound from the back like Devin
Is it peeps in my crib? Yo I spit
No fear, I kick em on up outta here
Approachin, larger and larger, bright light
Now clearer, my mirror

Chorus:

Mirror mirror mirror on the wall
Who is the top choice of them all?
Mirror mirror mirrror on the wall
Who is the top choice?
Mirror mirror mirror on the wall
Who is the top choice of them all?
Mirror mirror (Tell me what you see)

Now I'm sorta perplexed, what's next?
I can't front, I'ma little bit nervous, no longer vexed
My imagination or H2O had to flow, hard to tell
For three-fourth's water is my shell
I take a step, it takes me light years, turn to molecules
See so many stars like follicles
I'm turnin, spinnin, twistin twistin I feel tight
At a 186 thousand miles per second, the speed of light
Suddenly I land in darkness, I'm there, where?
A 144 thousand degrees in the juice square
I see pyramids and sands
My ancestors makin more noise than the lands and brass bands
Toby, what was to come of us before?
That I am the, original god man for sure
Now that was nothin, I didn't know worthwhile
but had to hear it, from the lord, my god within myself

Chorus

All around me were princes and thieves
Queens and sisters with long hair, some caught some with weaves
There were butter, gold, diamonds and coal
The rest is avoided, no mad sellin, it's soul-to-soul
Then I asked the wise men, "Why where I from is like hell?"
He said "Indeed, for they know not where the true god dwell"
????? ????? ?????, don't stop, who be on top?
Who be the only one sheltered when the real bomb drop?
I said "Back where I'm from, my peeps are scared to unite"
"They can't help it, for they been denied their birth right
Stripped of all culture, language, God
That's why Smooth B, times are so hard"
I cried "I hate the other man", then he said "Smooth can
before you hate, examine his mindstate"
Holy scientist turned darkside, why brothers
sit for 6000 years, he's made man will rule his father
For that vacuum in time
He told me when I touch back to Earth, bust heads with a rhyme
So, 4004 BC, go get'cha pilot
For the time has come, when only the fittest who seek survival
Started with the lies, then the murder of both wombs
Hid the truth like jewels and in Egyptian tombs
And today we bare scars
but we been around, before the Moon was split from Earth and replaced for
Mars
And we'll be around for eternity, made clearer
when we find the god within self, the true mirror

En frente de las camaras, dos cuerpos choka
I gotta knock it up the box one more time
She asked, "Ese Daz, can you press rewind?"
Cause mami likes to watch herself on camera

Put your legs on my shoulder, let me handle this

Song:   Mo' Money
Typed by: mover2k@swbell.net

Yeah,  Classics... it's true LA

Back as a little lad, tears on my pillow,had me
Workin' the block, hard as a brillo pair,he
Searchin' the block high off a nickel-bag
I searched my room, found my chrome mini-mag
Now we own one and won't give my pistol back
Guess he didn't figure, I want the hate 'zine
Mama said I'm 18, so I gotta shake scene
So I move on my daydreams
Like the A-Team

[Chorus]
Mo money, mo money, mo
Mo burden, Mo burden, mo
Not funny, not funny, no
Gotta have heat, this world is so cold

[Repeat chorus]

I'm the young Mr. T, with THC
All through my respiratory, that's mandatory
Self-explanatory
The black MacGyver
Wolfpack Messiah
The Rappin' sire, spit
Rapid fire, that's a strap
No heat in these streets
That's a wrap
With no rap for us, you can trust
It's a home robbery, and we wrap you up. yep
All my homies kept guns, so I kept one
The hood had love for me, like I was a stepson
Even when I'm spaced out, high as the jetsons
Not Elroy, do not tell boy
But you do not know
Cause you do not help the boy
Heat smelt the boy
Boy will grow, jails will blow
Half your brains out so to hell you go. Yep

[Chorus 2X]

No jewels on my neck, but my minds an emerald
Police shine lights tryin to find new criminals
I don't speak to y'all, but I rhyme subliminal
With y'all street soldiers, and I'm the general
My physical is pitiful, pistols make you invisible
My livings ain't livable, I slang from my living room
And I know that my livers doomed
We all in the killer mood, life wasn't silver spoons
No Ricky Schroeder, just Dickie Dozier, Pac
And we thug unorthodox
I wanna change, but its hard to abort the block
They trained a young champ in his sport to box
Dead bodies, rigor mortis, the corpse of rot
Don't report to the cops from the porch when it's hot
Tryin' to watch everything, like reporters watch
I'ma rap til this hot damn recording stop

[Chorus 2X]

Song:   The Moment I Feared
Typed by: bootleg210@msn.com

[Tame 1]
Ya know I'm sayin, so I'm sayin..
Ya know I'm sayin, so I'm sayin..

[Verse 1]
I had to listen to yo' mixtape, grttin my teeth
The last song on the tape, oh what a relief
The music sounded booty and as rigid as tin
So I took it out and put my own tape in
Now I'm happy as can be it's workin out so well
People said I couldn't do it on the mic without L
It's the year two-thou, niggaz soundin like hell
Put out independent singles, hopin my shit sells
Now back on the scene, I don't bother no one
I roll strictly with the Sqwad who let me do Tame 1
All my blackin out is over, it's time to have fun
I be smokin Isabella with this kid named John
Gettin blunted up in front of clubs in NYC
We went to this open mic event and got in free
Grabbin all the girlies booties, takin ecstasy
Cuz I'm a wild north nigga and they don't stress me
Durban Dayer spit the vapor for some light ring smoke
And the club security was lookin all down my throat
Is it cuz I'm Tame, and I'm always blunted?
Security ran down tellin me to gut it
It was the moment I feared..

[guard] Yo yo yo, you can't blaze up in here
[guard] Take it down five times George
[Tame1] This is the moment I feared
[guard] Yo don't make me take it from you
[guard] Put it out or get out muhfuckers

[Verse 2]
I said, "Yo this is the deal, we only came for the girls
And for you takin my dutch, ain't no way in the world"
He said, "Tame you know the game and how the NY change"
Kicked us out the club and had to go back home in the train
So I went to a buddha spot, yo we got us a nick'
So we smoked and we joked about some industry shit
Saw my money on the block with this chick named Brenda
I used to hit, but I acted like I couldn't remember
She shouted me out, but I really couldn't hear her
So I got a little bit closer just to hear a little clearer
She said, "I'm lookin for Salem where I think they sell weed at"
I said, "I know where that's at, cuz it's around where I be at"
I gave her the information and she went on her way
I went home and took it down till almost two the next day
Someone's ringin my bell, I opened up word bond
It was Brenda half-naked with a edible thong
Tried to suit me and seduce me, and at first I wasn't wit it
Then she licked it and I hit it, then we did it, and we did it
She said it was great, she said she was glad that we done it
I walked her to the bus but money grip was on it
It was the moment I feared..

[money] Yo what is you doin wit ya hand all over my girl's ass duke?!
[Tame1] Easy, easy duke
[money] Easy? Yo what is you doin up here
[Tame1] Hold up hold up, take it up witcha girl
[money] I just KNOW y'all ain't get to fuck that lil' bitch!

[Verse 3]
While he was wylin out and blackin then he swung on me (word)
Then I pulled out the weapon then I silenced the hump
Then he was dead to the head, I took the cash and the Visa
She said, "We gotta merk" not wantin people to see us
We went up to the crib, she had some leak in the freezer
She said, "We're rich! We're rich! We can have whatever would please us"
Now I don't fuck with nothin that ain't good for my health
So I put this boogers head out then I went for Delf'
Now I was rich, yes I was rich, I could have whatever would please me
Rock jewels in front of the haters that used to tease me
Pop me, spot me jumpin outta the truck
Kids be runnin up all screamin, "Yo Tame whassup!!"
I guess I was too flossy, but I'm sorry to say
Because this copper ran up on me, tell ya make my day
I said, "Relax brother" but he had proof that I had done it
Cuz he had poor Pervis' underwear with my fingerprints all on it
This was the rise and fall of my ill lifestyle
Cuz I was the main event on the TV for awhile
But now I'm in jail doin life, and it's beat
Cuz everytime I take a shower niggaz tryna peek
It was the moment I feared..

[inmate] Yo whatchu got up under that towel nigga?
[Tame 1]  Man, move ya fuckin hand man!
[inmate] Nigga, come here for a minute!
[Tame 1] It was the moment I feared..
[Tame 1] Yo y'all fuckin butt-pirates better back the fuck up!
[inmate] Give the ass up nigga!
[Tame 1] It was the moment I feared..

Slim Rick.. geuss who's back..
Ricky Walters..
Who's that cat.. bitch..
Maheem Brown.. uh uh
Eastern Conference in the..
Boom Sqwad in the.. the R the R..
Cuz that's the way it hafta be
Jokers are wild, if ya wanna beat Tame..
Deep concentration, cuz I'm no comedian..
Rhymin graffitian.. north to south...

Song:   Money For Nothing
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro: Yazz]
Consumers, silver spooners
It's nothin', we get money for it

[Verse 1: Jussie Smollett]
Commas and zeros, that's the way we do it
We make it work in this economy
Rollin' dinero, pockets stay polluted
Money is dirty and we don't play clean
We chasin' paper, run, run, hurry, move it
Get out the way if you ain't 'bout that green
Intensive labor, taxes are included
Ain't nothin' in this effin' world for free

[Pre-Chorus: Jussie Smollett]
We got to install microwave ovens
Custom kitchen deliveries
We got to move these refrigerators
We got to move these color TVs

[Verse 2: Yazz]
We are the people who turn illegal to legal
We take the good with the evil, create more sales than the Beatles
And the lion's our logo, we the sharks in the water
Multimedia moguls, more offices than the oval
We do everything, pull up in the game to entertain
Finish it by any means necessary
We everywhere, millionaires, billionaires, visionary
Back to business, let's just spend, think it in and celebrate

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus x2: Yazz (Jussie Smollett)]
(Move that work, move that work)
Commercialize, commercialize
(Get that work, get that work)
To advertise, to advertise
(Make it work, make it work)
Look mom, I'm on TV
(Gotta make it work, make it work)
Hi mom, I'm on TV

[Bridge x2: Jussie Smollett (Yazz)]
My talent's worth a fortune (500)
They know that I'm a boss
I got the ice flossin'
I'm all about my business (all about my money)
I'm all about my business

Verse 1 *(San Quinn)*

I'm sky ballin, a young California pimp
loungin in a stretch Bently sittin low on the tens
ice down, draped an dipped hittin bomb weed (bomb weed)
pushin on stega shrimp, sippin Dom P (Dom P)
lavishly cordinated
savagly corperated
on casino, Mr. Gambino's Mobb affiliated
the world is mine that's what I read on the blimp
playin cops I'm a robber wit blue prints to the mint
didn't leave no evidence, back to my residence
snatch the Benjamin's an all the other dead presidents
my hoochies like to toss me the coochie
floss me in Gucci
but groupies would never cost me no Loochie
what I look like?
givin a hoe all my doe, like she wrote all my flows
bitch I'm all-pro
you be the same hoe on the stroll makin me mo dinero
so tip-toe through the rain, sleet an snow.

*(Chorus)* x2

I gotta get my Money Ova Bitches
they want the money, I want my riches.

Verse 2 *(Messy Marv)*

Quinnton mania, hoes I'm tamin ya
never praisin ya, never payin ya
nuthin mo than attention
havin paper is an addiction
your not bringin additions
then subtract yo self from my juristictions
this how I'm seein it
my crew would be the cleanest
pushin Benzes an Beamers
these hoes ain't pleased to meet us
pass us Master Cards an Visa's
illegal searches
we smokin roaches wit no crutches
bitches we cope from bein broke an do it like a hustla
an ain't no friends we all cousins
baby networkin
money ain't nuthin you got it all you need to quit perpin'
a quarter million wouldn't satisfy me
I be a master like P
an I act like Luni
only God can do me
burn a crutch wit doobie, approach smoothly
only ladies wit paper amuse me, an broke hoes choose me
but lose bein in a pursuit of tryin to talk
for the conversation of fuck you an shit bitch it's goin to cost.

*(chorus)* x2

Verse 3 *(San Quinn)*

I got 2 for 1, from ye-yo to indo
paper now, hoes later, the tradition in Fil-mo
dime-els, bricks of ye-yo, coke dealers crack sales
niggaz that tell on big wheelers
young killaz, bitches that jock, look at 'em stare
got 'em choosin, got hoes droolin on a playa
my gold teeth glare, shinnin like cheese goin "Gling"
knock out playa, K.O.P. in the street
I fuck wit big timers, ridin sideways wit young thugs
don't manipulise, of Fil-mo hood nudge
shake hood slugs, make hood drugs
never could, never would a nigga hoe trust
Money Ova Bitches
trust a bitch I never would
I'm too major
havin paper like Tiger Woods
famous in the Mobb 
rob from the rich slang ye-yo to the poor
flippin, manipulatin a dumb hoe
fo way mo
I tell 'em BIA-TCH!!
I love ballin, how could I be tired of bein rich?
been off the hook so long, got disconnected unexpected
an you niggaz is wrong fo payin hoes an hoes protected.

Check check check it out, check it out, check it out
Check check check it out, check it out, check it out

We need, more prisons, like a hole in the head
A prison is a home for the living dead
It is time for us to recognize that every man must be free
if we really want to see eternity

Understand that the spirit, is a prime source of life
that can only be stifled, when put behind bars
We must all have an opportunity to shine like stars

We need more prisons like a hole in the head
Prisons create, living dead
Prisons create, living dead

Nigga's don't believe until they see it's out
stupid motherfuckers want to take the scenic route, now the heater's out
Bitches scream like I pulled my penis out
beggin' me to put that big motherfucker away, but the demon's out
Everybody on the floor, come out of that (?)
Come out of them diamonds and you come out of that velour
The party is over, shut the fuck down, cut the music *scratches*
matter of fact turn it back up shit I could use it (ohhhhh)
I need the noise in case I have to let a couple off
saw another icey chain, walked over and tugged it off
Give me that butter soft, and since you buyin' out the bar
you can buy my drinks for today and tomorrow
I'm out for the paper, my homie better hide the jewels
I'm in the game starvin, and I ain't playin buy the rules nigga

I got love, went through some shit but now the medicine's done
Concocted hot shit, straight off the block like rocks did
Melody, you corny MCs we make smedley's
With no corner degrees, y'all tryin to pass the gology
Check your history then I'm a Southside resident
Holdin quarter bricks yo back when Reagan was President

[Prince Poetry]
We be the rugged N-Y's, Medicinemen, intelligent
My two's spread nights with hustlers under streetlights
The beat strike vital hearts as I heat mics
Hot lava in the form of words
Got you lovin this natural high as I spit these 'erbs
Embrace, lace it with this impeccable taste
Got the club rockin, titties mad hard off the bass
Ya heard? A nigga gotta always make moves
And continue to shine like Armourall on the shoes, what? Huh

	[Chorus - x2]

[Prince Poetry]
Yo, I'm on a mish' to get rid of dead weight, ready to bubble
Too much shit in this life to juggle, this for real struggle
I keep it movin with all three eyes open (Hah)
Lyrical content is potent, rather well spoken
I'm massin all my niggas to get it cos wit it
we all movin, without it we all lose, I'm about it
But we split it (50-50 nigga), if I bust shots to cover your back
I give it up to see where some niggas' heads are at
Cos brothers do get grimy over nickels and dimes
And if you was my man you wouldn't be reachin for mines
Damn, catch me on Liberty in the van
but one block over, on the corner devisin the plan
My niggas Rude and Nice be holdin me down (for real) since a teen
Now we some veterans of this medicine, stackin the green
From 7-1-8, to 7-0h-2, to 5-1-Oh
Poe'll make ya shake the stress so act like ya know huh, what?

	[Chorus - x2]

[Rude One]
Yo half my niggas been, sent to the essence, I make the best of a
tight situation, organizin emancipation
To live life, rip mics, get nice without fights (Ugh)
Copyright my shit (ugh) and get paid in the spotlight

[Prince Poetry]
I'm still buckwild like a cock fight, take flight only to win
But if I fail all I know is I'm startin over again
Forty projects baby boy, still stickin and movin like Roy
Prince Poe lyrically bringin you joy
What? What? What?
C'mon

	[Chorus - x2]

[Outro - Prince Poe]
C'mon, uh-huh-huh-huh
'98 or better baby, this is how we do it
Ugh, to all my peoples come on
It's all good, gotta few words to uplift the spirits, no doubt
New York, outer city limits, it's all good baby boy
Don't hate girl, lemme holler atcha for a while
Uh-hah, ugh ugh, la-la-la, la-la-la, la
Yeah, believe me yo, get it twisted, get smacked motherfucker
* laughter * But it's all love y'knowI'msayin?
Y'knowI'msayin I be the God, you be the thug

Verse 1:
As I represent for my hip hop nation
Brothers bracin' for a taste of the bass and
Real niggas kick the real feel I guess 
This is the way that niggas do it from around my rest
So here I go check 1-2 with the crew
Hittin' you brother from another Planet but I'm Digable
Never play the fool you do if you assume 
That I couldn't make a record checkin' wrock on the boom
Even form my first I was diverse with the verse
Use to hope fro the best and if worse came to worse
I just marinate my spiral notebook with rhymes with possitive mind 
Waitin' for my time to shine
I seen a million video's I heard a million wack albums
That still couldn't even go gold if you comiled 'em
I bet your bottom dollar or your last four quarter if ya wanna
I'm strickly blowin' niggas out the water

Hook:
Now all my peoples are you in here? HELL YEAH
All my peoples are you in here? HELL YEAH
All my peoples are you in here? HELL YEAH
If so let me know you get doe is you with me?
All my peoples are you in here? HELL YEAH
All my peoples are you in here? HELL YEAH
To all peoples are you in here? YEAH
We got the funk in the trunk we not drunk but we tipsy

Verse 2:
Yeah niggas talking loud but ain't sayin' nothin'
Puffing and puffing enough enough with your bluff (what?)
Screwin' up your grill I guess you feel real tough
What make a rapper hardcore is when his rhymes be rough
So I can still keep on I drop a bomb like Sadamm
Hussein keep a half a paragraph on your brain, uh
That's what makes the Clean Cut hot like a diamond
Brothers isn't tryin' to be vibin' while I be rhymin'
This is for my peoples from around the way
Maintain your game like everyday
Never half step and get it all I say
If a nigga violated then he gots to pay
I see 'em hawkin' stalkin' when I'm walkin'
King of New York andI let my style do my talking
When I delete the weak they meet defeat when I speak
Cause I'm so heavy I leave my footprints in concrete

Hook

Scratching "That's how it is"

Verse 3:
I stick the style I make you wanna studder
Hummina hummina all day never Parkay keep it butter bra
Brother broham you know who I am
God damn don't you ever try to sham on your fam
Cause everywhere we go you know my crew roll deep
Stayin' alive we survive on the Bedstuy streets
True believer you can either catch a fever
Or go out in a blaze with your hands on your heater (whoa)
Teacher teacher this is how I reach ya reach ya
It's the Clean Cut on the feature 
Now what ya seen will make you fiend 
The kid with the clean cut laid back demenor
Shootin' my words like sperm they jangle jingle
Dad I need a bag I had to bust nut on the single (aaah)
I'm comin' out the east the biters need to cease
Two is on each I'm out y'all peace

Intro/Outro: all

Hey brown suga, you know my name
No need to front, if the thought's the same
I got one night in town don't play no games
Let's get it on no need for shame
(repeat 2X)

Verse One: Sadat X

The X is like a monument, I'm old New York
I hope you know where I'm comin from
You got to take some, and then you leave some
Good food, shoes and clothes
Stay away from the nasty hoes
Your old pops he don't like my style
He resort to callin names as long as names stay names and no games
I resist the urge to blast his old ass to flames
A long hot summer, with no contract
One-twenty blocks, breakin open that pack
Your role models, now down with the bottles
That's over near the store with the reinforced door
and the breakaway for a pitbull named Thor, hah
For real Slim, for real cause I can't stress no ass
Cause it's, one where you came from, just like the same one
That was there yesterday, today, tomorrow
Assembly car lines, line em up from behind
Sick that ass like a cactus, react to this dick, uh!
Helmet wrapped tight sees no daylight
I roll two-ply duke and that's a must
Picture me knockin off shorty here with the rawness
A year or two later got ta hear it
And ain't got long to live, and ain't got long to live

Good lovin, food and clothes
Stay away from the nasty hoes
(repeat 2X)
Just live, and let live... niggaz, live, and let live

Verse Two: Fat Joe

Welcome to the world of AIDS is what she wrote
on the mirror with the red lipstick before I woke
Who would ever think that this would happen to me
Bitch hit me off with HIV, purposely
Met her at the club, think it was the Copa
Scopin out her thighs and, sizin up her chocha
Seductive red dress, lookin Halle Barry-ious
What's your name Miss?  "Sixty-Nine"  Nice alias
Next thing you know, face up the asshole
Tongue on the clit, chick screamin "Ay Fat Joe!"
Didn't have to taste her, but the puss was callin me
Think that I should lace her "Nah it's much safer orally"
The moral to the story is the mustard's all around
So boricuas watch to see that you can catch it goin downtown
Practice safe sex never flex unprotect
I ain't really got AIDS, it's just a motherfuckin record

[Sideways] *talking*
Yeah
This goes to all them folks
Who like them nasty girls
Now I ain't talkin' about these
"Make love to me"
"Take care of me" lil' thangs
I'm talkin' about buck sessions
Late night creepin's
Straight nasty girls

[Chorus] x 2 *girl moaning*
A nasty girl is what I need and what I want
A nasty girl is super bad, I'd love the flaunt
Nasty girls creep in the back seat
Nasty girls stay nasty everyday of the week

[Sideways]
They say the freaks come out at night time
Written rhymes, lookin' fine
Make some pimp lines wit dollar signs
Brown hair, deriair thick
Took her to my lair
And I swear that I hit this
She said somethin' about a man but that's irrelavent
Had her suckin' on my trunk like I was an elephant
Low tail, [?], 60, feelin' tipsy
Breakin' out the hatters on the ladder
Better miss me
Sicky Sideways only came for one thang
Gettin' bomb headshots in the leftlane
I'm 'bout to cave in
Playa like gold and I'm engravin'
Makin' my toes pop high, freaky relations

[Martie Bacardii 151]
Martie I'm Bacardii is back again
Wit these raps that you haters just don't understand
I spot you at the party
"Do you have a man" [Girl: "No"]
She replied "No"
Another fuck friend
I lace her up with game
She asked from where I came
I tell her Yoc Town friends "Germany and Spain"
She started goin' low
You know how the story goes
I had it all sold
Picture perfect frame
I ain't ashamed
Cuz this girl is jockin' for my name
I turned around and asked you girls
What this street bacame
[Girl: Oh my God]

[Chorus] x 2

[Sideways]
Chalk up another statty, rollin' fatties
Call me Sugar Daddy, 2003 Caddy
As I skywalk
Left for drag on the sidewalk
Low pro, low key
Your hoes and me
Those hoes in heat
Slow platinum game through her earlobes
Moanin' so loud
I had her face in the pillow
Diary of a pimp
I got a glimps of my movato
Seen her lookin' tasty in Chevy Sirverado
So I paused
"Excuse me miss, what's your name
[Girl: "Candy"]
I couldn't quite catch it
But heard somethin' 'bout a candy cane

[Martie Bacardii 151]
Scene two, me and you up at the rendezvous
I had the glass of Henn
This girl had the attitude
I thought to shoot and score
But then decided to ignore
She sat down next to me
I'm gonna get her [?]
[Girl: "My name is Candy"]
She said: [Girl: "This bar is such a bore"]
I fed her Brandy
Next scene I'm in a Super Sport
Where we're goin' but I'm knowin'
Back to her fort
And for a long time
I wasn't comin' up short
Difference to what a girl will give up, Chassy
But for true happiness
Finally that's nasty

[Chorus] x 2

[Sideways]
Me and my folks like nasty freaks
And we peepin'
Call the Mexican, Perto Rican
Somethin' 'bout caucasians
Lovin' on them Asians
All the freaky deekies keep my bed squeaky
From U.S.S.R. freaks to the Middle East
To Eastern Greek, Italy, and France [?] capish
Love them mixed girls
The big hips girls
The big girls wit twigs girls
That make their limbs twirl
Them ghetto mamies
To not to name Ivana
The late night love session freakies [?]
Out
I love them freaky deeky girls no doubt

[Intro]
If you got the time, I got the time..

[Toddy Tee] 
Yo, what's up, man?

[Ice-T] 
Yo, what's happenin?

[Toddy Tee]
Man, I went to this party last week, man
This girl cold dissed me, man, cause I didn't have on no gold, man

[Ice-T]
Are you serious man?!
That's tough, tell me what happened

[Verse 1: Toddy Tee]
Went to a party, freaks on the wall
DJs and Emcees and everybody was havin' to ball
And as I walked through the party my mind flipped
I left my gold at home and I tripped
Goupies, skeezers, girls glore
Everybody was movin' the body on the dance floor
Looked on the stage, two guys there were rappin'
Gold around their neck, this DMC stuff is happenin'
Looked to my left, spotted a freak
I mean man.. she looked that good, that I was scared to speak
My homeboys, they begin to brag 
Put your money on the table, would you go for my drag?
I said: honey hi!, I wish I was you, so I can make love to me 
She said: you serious?
I said: yes, my name is T&T,
She cold dissed me, wouldn't give me respect
No golds on my neck, I need a Rolex

[Hook: Mix Master Spade]
I need a rolex.. I need a rolex..
If you got the time, I got the time..

[Verse 2: Toddy Tee]
That's right, I said Rolex, you heard it my friend
What did it cost? ---> King TEE
Put it like this, I could've bought a Benz 
But I said to myself, I need to look up class
I need somethin' that it stand out, somethin' that it last
So I went to Salavix, this saleslady: said what's up?
I said: yo, I need the whole damn hook up
18K, bought a watch and chain 
And a necklace with diamonds and grayed with my name
Now, I'm lookin' deaf, ultimately cool and in a <Name> mall
I shopped at the <Trademark> and bought me a bunch of dress codes
Gorche and Slacks, I won't wear a Vila, too many people wears that
Now, I'm drapped in my Alligator Shoes 
And that's a real, that if you touched them they'll bite you
It's '88, now, I'm rockin' the house
So clear the way to the stage, cause I'm steppin' out

[Hook: Mix Master Spade]
I need a rolex.. I need a rolex..
If you got the time, I got the time..

[Verse 3: Toddy Tee]
Now, I'm back at the party
A week later they let me through the doors
My Alligator Shoes, cause I screwed, the people drool 
And the guys in the back are sayin: You're so cool
Now, I'm standin' on stage, hands gripped on the mic
Rolex shinnin' and blindin' them in the light
And as I rocked them and begin to shout
Yo T man, you looked pimped out
So I said: yo thank you, my show is about to over
They said we want more, so I looked over my shoulder
And there she was starin' in my eyes 
Ms. material girl, was hypnotized 
By my jewelry, I couldn't understand
I knew right then, the Rolex was in command
She said: I love you with all respect
There's no gold on your neck, girl, you need a Rolex

[Hook: Mix Master Spade]
I need a rolex.. I need a rolex..
If you got the time, I got the time..

Jealousy
A little greed

Of what I need
Purple leaves
With crystal flakes
If it's not hydro, please get that out my face

Cause I made a bong out this old steam cleaner

and one day
did ya think a trip to be a fade
would get me a maid moppin marble floors in Monteray
betray me, degrade me

Fed Ex'ed to my cornas from across the border, uh
Is it a Datsun or Toyota?
My get away car stay far from my Jona
I'm solid two soldier

groom the truth wit the triumph an anguish
mutha fuckas take they best shot but they miss me
playa hatas hide on steps so they can trip me.

Chorus 2x *(B.A.)*

Don't be afriad boy, it's too late

Verse 2

They got the weed spots
scoldin hot
in the discrepency

rusted brass knuckles in my highschool locker
laced wit sacred fundamentals of connivin
strapped under the seat of every vehicle I ride in
witness me
watch me
break the monotany
real niggas shall prevail
we do the ridin G
sacrifice my flesh wit Satin before you kill me
spread my blood over wax let the world feel me
Got a dubb of dope?
Nope, I got a dime though
good an bad playas, tug-a-war wit my mind flow
I'm sick an tired
of bein sick an tired

Verse 3

We got the block locked

this life of sin what ever the cost is of quittin

Never sad, always glad
Not a day you find him mad
Ain't nothin I never had
Sleek, sleek, so unique
Guaranteed to move your feet
So everytime I play the beat
Ladies get up out their seat

[ L.A. Sunshine ]
The wheelin, stealin, double-dealin
Man who rocks it on a feelin
Give you more of rhymes galore
I shoot my shot, I always score
Girls on my jock and on the lock
The man who rock around the clock
I never date, I never wait
The man who set the people straight

[ Spoonie Gee ]
Well, Spoonie Gee, as you could see
I rock the whole society
I always rock, as you can tell
I rock with all the clientele
Finesse is do you know I will
I keep the people starin still
Eyes swollen, rhymes tollin
Comin out this microphone

[ Kool Moe Dee ]
Remember me, MC Moe Dee
The man that's at the t-o-p
A ladies dream the way it seem
When they see me, their eyes are gleam
And I'm so shockin when I'm rockin
Bound to get your fingers poppin
Have no doubt, I turn it out
Cause that's a party's all about

[ Special K ]
Equal sharin, always carin
Man who rhymes with all the darin
Satisfaction guaranteed
Givin you just what you need
I'm Special K with all the plannin
No defeat, the Mozart standin
When I look into the mirror
Knowin there's no one to see

[ L.A. Sunshine ]
A ???, that'll do it 
I don't need some disco fluid
Ball-playin, girl-layin
On the mic I'm rhyme-sayin
MC who rock viciously
Satisfaction guaranteed
Or you'll get your money back
Believe me, girl, it's not the wack

[ Spoonie Gee ]
Well, I'm indeed the one that leave
With any girl I wish to see
That make her smile and never frown
Cause I'm the man who get on down
Have everybody feel they face
And give their tongue a taste
Don't try to make em scream and shout
Just show em what it's all about

[ all ]
Treacherous Three as you can see
Special K
Sunshine
And Kool Moe Dee
And don't forget MC Spoonie Gee

[ Special K ]
For MC's who bite 
The fast-talkin rhymes
They're gonna feast
So get ready to eat
Moe Dee's the originator 
So you might as well starve
Cause you can't catch this fast beat
(Hit it, Moe)

[ Kool Moe Dee ]
Hey, diddle-diddle on the fiddle
Cause the cat is in the middle
Will he rhyme or will he riddle
Does he ???
Have a lot, may be a little
Low cause he can feel his middle
And an ocean full of lotion
Cause it's like his magic potion
But my notion's that the potion
Work itself up like a motion
When you're catchin Superman
And you don't seem to understand
Instead of high he's in the aisle
???
But the cat was found missin somewhere on the line
The only thing he hears bein deaf because of Kool Moe Dee 
??? walkin ??? whether talkin on the street
Whether north or south or east
Whether human or a beast
I'm so full of disco (power)
It ain't a MC that I can't devour
In a hour talkin fast and he goes sour
Moe Dee, the disco tower power
So take a deep breath, get a drink of water
Special K, you can say it, but make yours shorter

[ Special K ]
Well, I'm so sincere, just sincere
The baddest MC of the year
Say it low, say it loud 
Say it special, say it proud
Takin every year in hell
I weigh the highest on the scale
When I rock I take a bow
Sunshine, come on and show em how

[ L.A. Sunshine ]
The girl-teasin, woman-pleasin
Take a girl, others freezin
Got the heart to play the part
I'm not too sweet, I'm not too tart
We're rappin to the funky beat
The kids all chowed like us like a treat
So come on then and get a taste
Believe me, girl, it's not a waste

[ Kool Moe Dee ]
The super-rhymin, fascinatin
Faster rhyme originatin
Number one when I'm creatin
Number one with no debating
If you look up on the rating
You will see that you're degrading
And you're only commentating
And that gets to be frustrating

[ Special K ]
Yes, for real, we are the deal
And on the mic we use our skill
The latest greatest, no one hate us
Take us home, we're gold-plated
Rappin raw and never bore
And always keep you on the floor
And rock and roll and take control
And rock until we're grey and old

[ L.A. Sunshine ]
The law-abiding, never fighting
Girls are ??? hiding
Pain-enduring, love-ensuring
Cool, calm, and most alluring
Constant on the jock
The man who make the party rock
I gratify and satisfy
Girl, just say, just say good-bye

[ Spoonie Gee ]
Well, I'm lettin you know I am a pro
Just give me a mike, I'm on the go
[ Treacherous Three ]
The three MC's that never freeze
That rock you on down to your knees
[ Spoonie Gee ]
Like Earl the Pearl that shocked the world
Spoonie Gee attracts a girl
[ Treacherous Three ]
We're cool and calm and have the charm
Young ladies say we mean no harm
[ Spoonie Gee ]
S-p-o-o-n-y Gee
[ Special K ]
S-p-e-c-i-a-l K
[ L.A. Sunshine ]
The S-u-n-s-h-i-n-e
[ all ]
Moe Dee, all the way, y'all

[ Kool Moe Dee ]
To the south, to the west, to the east, to the north
(Come on, Moe Dee, you go off, you go off)
Well, I can shock ya and amaze ya
Then I hit ya, then I did ya
Either way I'm gonna faze ya
But I never ever played ya
Cause that is your own behaviour
And the cost is in our favor
And since you're on the jock, you can choose your favorite flavor
If you don't know what's the matter
We can serve ya on a platter
And for your delight, well, we can add a little batter
To the south, to the west, to the east, to the north
Come on, Special K, go off, go off

[ Special K ]
Cause we're a top organization
And we're here to rock the nation
We need cooperation to perform this devastation
Have you swingin, have you swayin
On the mic, and I be sayin
No more jokin, no more playin
We rock with no delayin
>From the south to the west, to the east, to the north
Come on, Sunshine, go off, go off

[ L.A. Sunshine ]
Say rag-tag, garbage bag
Other MC's know the half
With no permission they all listen
Get their rods and they go fishin
To the bottom of the pod
And bite our rhymes no matter how the party people know we rock
So they can stay all on the jock

[ Special K ]
>From the south to the west, to the east, to the north
Come on, Moe Dee, go off, go off

[ Kool Moe Dee ]
And to the D-a-n-o B
Well, Dano B is at the t-o-p
The Superstar, as you can see
The slicker, quicker, magic tricker
On the mixer there's no one quicker
Any sign of magic tricks 
There's no man quicker on the mix
Go by the name of the Superstar
So young ladies (ho!) from near or far
Whether you're high-class or rather bourgeois
Whether you live close, or you live far
Whether bus, by train, or even car
You better come and check out the Superstar
It's Dano B, deejay for me
You say cause my presentation when I'm in the nation
Causes total fascination and a total jubilation
With your cooperation and your participation
Don't give no complication, check out acceleration
Talkin faster every second 
Other MC's now I reckon
You will wanna bite and chew
Sit back, listen, what you do
Get your pencil, papers and pad
You listen to me like I was your dad
Gonna write the rhymes down to 'Rhymes Galore'
Better tally it up like it was a score
And when it comes to the fly girls, all the things you were taught
You see a pretty young lady, but have second thought
Because her face is on, but her body ain't so hot
Now maybe you should have her, or maybe not
Well, if you rather have a bunch of ??? upon a ???
??? cause she's just a freak 
No way that you can reach your peak
On a girl who conversate
And make sure that her head is straight
But when she don't participate
The other girl is not too late
Take it light, because you're blue
Think about it, what you do
Think about it like a man
And someday you will understand
Sex-sex-sex is the law-law-law
When a guy gets a guy on the floor-floor-floor
He sticks his information into her communication
And for further information try the Board of Education
The Army, the Navy, United States Nation
Let's rock, y'all, and don't stop
Ya keep on and shock the house
[ all ]
Because we rock non-stop
Because we rock non-stop
Because we rock non-stop
Because we rock non-stop
Because we rock non-stop
Because we rock non-stop
Because we rock non-stop
Because we rock non-stop
Because we rock non-stop

Ah New York New York big city of dreams
And everything in New York ain't always what it seems
You might get fooled if you come from out of town
But I'm down by law and I know my way around, too much
Ah too many people, too much -- a ha hah
Too much, too many people, too much, rrrrrrrah!

A castle in the sky, one mile high
Built to shelter the rich and greedy
Rows of eyes, disguised as windows
Lookin DOWN on the poor and the needy
Miles of people, marchin up the avenue
Doin what they gotta do, just to get by
I'm livin in the land of plenty and many
But I'm damn sure poor and I don't know why

Too much, ah too many people, too much
Too much, too many people, too much!

A man's on a ledge, says he's gonna jump
People gather round, said, "He won't he's just a chump"
Cause he lost his job, then he got robbed
His mortgage is due and his marriage is through
He says he ain't gonna pay no child support
Because the bitch left him without a second thought
He got nothin to eat, no shoes on his feet
She even left his clothes, out in the street
He keeps hearin noises when he's at home
He always hears voices when he's all alone
His wife took the kids, the car and the crib
In this man's world, so much for women's lib

New York New York big city of dreams
But everything in New York ain't always what it seems
You might get fooled if you come from out of town
But I'm down by law, and I know my way around

Down in the Village, you might think I'm silly
but you can't tell the women from the men sometimes
They're sugar and spice and everything nice
But when you get em home ain't no tellin what you find
Right next door is a little old man
I seen him eatin dog food out of a can
He says, "I got to eat, when I can't afford meat
I barely can stand, on my own two feet"
I got a bad habit and I just can't break it
Somethin's on my mind and I just can't shake it
I need some time, and I want some space
I gotta get away from the human race

Too much, ah too many people, too much... a-ha hah
Too much, ah too many people, too much!  Rrrrrrrah!

Stand at a skyscraper reachin into heaven
When over in the ghetto I'm livin in hell
Just play ball or be an entertainer
cause niggaz like me can't read too well
Nobody loves me, nobody cares
I dreamed about a life but I'm livin in a nightmare
Paranoid schitzo, set back, snowbound
Bad news psycho, heart attack, breakdown!

Hee, huh (16X) HUH!

If only I could sleep just ten more minutes
I might find the strength to make another day
If I didn't have to get up, and do my thing
I would probably sleep my whole life away
I messed up a nice dream, somethin bout ice cream
Whipped cream fruits and a cherry on top
Now I gotta get up and face the world, huh
The pressure is on it ain't never gonna stop
I sho' gotta learn to use my mind
I don't wanna be kissin nobody's behind
Just standin on line lookin like a jerk
Gotta get off my butt and do a full day's work
I ran into a pothole, got into a car crash
Shoulda been thinkin and tried to fake whiplash
A crowd gathered round, they're callin me fat
Who you lookin at wit a face like that?

New York New York big city of dreams
Everything in New York ain't always what it seems
You might get fooled if you come from out of town
But I'm down by law and I know my way around

On 42nd Street, lookin for some action
Women standin on the corner sellin satisfaction
One young punk just leanin on the fence
Tryin to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
Really is a prankster, tried to be a gangster
Real big wheel when a gun is in his hands
Just did a stick-up, just got picked up
One dead punk, killed by the man

New York New York big city of dreams
And everything in New York ain't always what it seem
You might get fooled if you come from out of town
But I'm down by law and I know my way around
Too much, too many people, too much... ah ha hah hah
Too much, too many people, too much!  HUAHH!

A baby cries and a mother dies
And the tears fall from the doctor's eyes because
in this room, on this day
The Good Lord has giveth, and taketh away, huh
The gift of life really means a lot
And in the ghetto your life is all you got
So you take to the streets, tryin to exist
in the trash and slime of a world like this
What you watch, on TV
a tells you what life is supposed to be
But when you look outside the only thing you see
Is the poverty stricken, reality, heh
Abandoned places, angry faces
Much hate and hunger through-out the races
You say, "I'm grown and I'm on my own
So why don't everybody just leave me alone!"
Now you stay at home, talkin on the phone
Doin ninety miles an hour in the fifty mile zone
They never took the time to tell you bout sex
So you had to learn about it in the discotheques
Nine months later, the baby is there
and the nigga that did it said, "I don't care!"
You don't have enough money to help feed two
So you have to choose between the baby and you
The sky was cryin, rain and hail
When you put yo' baby in the garbage pail
Then you kissed the kid and put down the lid
And you tried to forget what you just did, huh
The muffled screams of a dyin baby
was enough to drive the young mother crazy
so she ran in the rain tryin to ease the pain
Huh huh, and she drove herself insane

New York New York big city of dreams
But everything in New York ain't always what it seem
You might get fooled if you come from out of town
But I'm down by law and I know my way around

Ah too much, too many people, too much... ah ha hah hah
Too much, too many people, too much!  HUHHH!

So what's happenin man?  What's happenin?
	Man you should see these bad girls out here workin the corner
Loose joints, loose joints!
	A hah hah hah
Aiyyo baby won't you come here man gimme a little somethin
	Let's try to get the money man
Aiyyo aiyyo y'all know this dude look he comin right here let's rob him man
	Ohh yeah yeah
Nah nah leave him alone
	Hey slick, you know your way to Sugarhill Records?
Ay man that's in Jersey nigga!  C'mere c'mere man whassup wit you?
(conversation disolves into a fight)

New York New York big city of dreams
But everything in New York ain't always what it seems
You might get fooled if you come from out of town
But I'm down by law and I know my way around
Too much, too many people, too much... ha hah hah hah
Too much, too many people, too much

Uh-uh, uh, uh, Yea homeboy
Who gangstas? Whattup Smut Peddlers
We gangstas, yeah
Niggaz don't know me, call me He
That's all you know, is these verses and his name
Nigga, nigga, nigga..

[Chorus]
Nickel Nine is.. Me not them
This is.. Him not they
Royce and Reef, Double-R
Beef is close, but trouble's far
Nickel nine is what the rhyme is
I put my time in nigga, nickel nine is
Uh uh, me not them
This is, him not they, he is..

[Royce the 5-9]
The reason why the funds is dizzy
Money continuously spinnin, round and around like a frisbee
My lungs is sticky from.. The second hand smoke
from out of the guns, they busy eh eh eh eh.. Come get me
He is, quick on the draw -- Same nine that I used
when you thought I copped it and popped it at the same time
Shit, carry tools, you gotta
The streets is overpopulated with niggas who cheat, like Andrew Guilota
Royce and Reef, Double-R when the gutter is beats,
meat with the treble bars, nothin but heat
Niggaz I'm in and outta this booth, like Clark Kent for the youth
Flying with the NARC-proof tent for the TRUTH
Niggas be trippin a lot, so I keep the longest clip in the lot
Hit you while you loadin the clip in the glock like BLOAW!
No life, no rep - the only games I play is you, he says like Mos Def
Nigga..

[Chorus]

[Royce the 5-9]
Over-protected, keep the coldest connections
When it goes in affect the only thing froze is the necklace
That's it, keep the gat by me, I'm not rowdy
So none of you's can see me like Jack Ponti
None of you niggaz bad as me
I got a +Mobb+ and we +Deep+ like Hav' and P, so get a job
My shoes is 9 and a half sizes too big
For every thug nigga listenin and not in the here
You better know that He is, a motherfuckin throwback
Rap shit nowadays is so wack, I wish I could go back
It's undone, so I spend money like
It's more where it came, even more where it didn't come from
The time it took to write this, I could be sellin twice this
And whipe shit, like my vemonmous drive is priceless
My goons they'll put you away
And if it's heat, then it's no beef homey I'll cook you today

[Chorus]

[Royce the 5-9]
I got niggas like "That's Eminem's man ain't it"
Like that's my name, like I changed it when my man became famous
By the way, you ain't beefin with Slim, you beefin with us
So stay out the magazines, keep it shhh hush, okay?
Rappers is hilarious dog
Never to big for that box, cuz the area's small
And you'll fit, six feet deep is where you'll sit
Bring it true, I'll turn sixteen deep into a trip to the sky...

Yeah, you don't wanna hover
Ya mommy wouldn't like it, whattup Proof
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yea

[Chorus]

[Royce talking]
Nickel nine is what the rhyme is
I put my time motherfucker nickel nine is
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yea
Yea, yea, yea, yeah

[Hook: Lina Santiago]
All the ladies
You know that it's Friday night
We're gonna just be good
So, we gotta do this right
It's time we hit the club

[Verse 1: Monteloco]
How can a thug look so crisp and clean
I hit the scene with the diamond pinky ring
Monteloco and Steve, you see, attack like vultures
Blame it on the yak
And the rap culture
If I got a girl or not
Don't trip
Ya out with ya girls
I'm out with my clique
Shit
We can do this every
Fin de semana
Trips to Encenada
Mama
Ain't nada
Holla

[Chorus: Lina Santiago]
Papi, I'm feeling you
Right here, right now
Tonight, I'm mobbing with my crew
It's girls night out
Tell me what you wanna do
What are you
About
Tonight, I'm mobbing with my crew
It's girls night out

[Verse 2]
T'oh!
You should've never let ya dame out
She's about to wild out
On girl's night out
I run with the vampires and the night owls/Knightowl's
Hit the honies up and say, "That's a nice blouse"
After the club, bunny, let's bounce to my house
Hit the hypnotic, then it's
Lights out
Send her back at 3:30
She's dirty
Next day, you forgive honey, cause she's pretty
She's pretty

[Repeat Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Drunk in the club
My vision is blurry
But I can see cleary
Baby, come near me
I'm a grown up, lookin' for a donut
(???) the glaze on and put the blaze on, and I
Treat 'em like dame piece, even though they five-piece
We just drunk, tryna get our thang sucked
Mad at ya boyfriend
Yo soy el vato
Sneak up into mom's crib, hit her in the quarto

[Repeat Hook]

[Repeat Chorus]

[Monteloco]
Yeah, mija
You get some of your friends
And I get some of my friends and
You know the rest

[Intro]
Ahh
Uh huh
Turn down, turn down
Hell naw, hell naw
Turn up, hell yeah

[Verse 1: Yazz]
My mouth is a weapon
I ain't scared of nethin'
They say he so reckless
Bunkie's in da casket
Better hit the exit
I eat you for breakfast
Diamonds on my necklace
Guess that's what I'm blessed wit
Ima revolutionary
Pardon my vocabulary
I don't even 'member ever carin'
Sue me when I'm in the cemetery
I'm legendary
Yeaaaaaaaa

[Chorus: Jussie Smollett]
I do what I want
And say what I want with no apologies
(Not uh not uh not uh)
Excuse me if I'm blunt
I say what I want with no apologies
(Oh ya oh ya oh ya)
And they won't shut me up
Hell naw, hell naw, hell naw
No they won't shut me up
Hell naw, hell naw, hell naw
I do what I want
And say what I want with no apologies

[Verse 2: Yazz]
They get mad
I keep on talkin'
Nevermind
I beg your pardon
Guess I'm just too damn outspoken
They can't take me anywhere
Will I ever learn my lesson
Try hard not to get arrested
Guess I didn't get da message
F' it
I don't really care

[Bridge: Jussie Smollett] + (Yazz)
So much in my head, ohhh
(I would let 'em know)
It's so hard not to let go
(I'm about da dough)
The closer that you get, they try to hold you back
But a closed mouth don't get fed, nooo
(And can't nobody stop me, y'all)
I ain't goin' nowhere
(Not even for Obama, y'all)
I'm a loose cannon
I'm comin' for ya (gunnin' for ya)
Hope you're ready (automatic)
Ready, ready
Aim, aim
Fire, fire
Legendary
Ooooooowwwww

[Chorus: Jussie Smollett]

[Verse 3: Yazz]
They can't be mad at me, look at my family
I guess it's all in my blood line
If you keep ridin' me for my apology
You'll be waitin' for a long time
Not sympathetic, I said it, I meant it
You don't like it then I could care less
Not sympathetic, I said it, I meant it
You don't like it then I could care less

[Outro: Jussie Smollett] + (Yazz)
I ain't sorry, I ain't sorry for nothin' I say
(One hand on the Bible, I ain't in denial)
I ain't sorry, I ain't sorry for nothin' I say
(Your honor, you can blame it on Tiana)
I ain't sorry, I ain't sorry for nothin' I say
(One hand on the Bible, I ain't in denial)
I ain't sorry, I ain't sorry for nothin' I say

Typed by: roach1984@hotmail.com

In my mind I'm a fighter, my hearts a lighter
My soul is the fluid, my flow sparks it right up
But arsenic writer, often with arth-er-itis
Carpel-tunnel, Marshal with start shit-itis
Hard-headed and hot-headed
Bull-headed and pig-headed
Dick-headed a prick, a big headache I'm sick
Quick with it for every lyric spit it
There are 6 critics who wait, for me to slip with it
So quick this dynamite stick, bury the wick
It's gonna ex-plode any minute, some lunatic
Lit it and its not Nelly, do not tell me to stop yelling
When I stop selling I'll quit so, stop dwelling
I am not failing, you fuckers are not ready
Cause I got jelly, like Beyonce's pot belly
This is destiny, yes money
I'm off running, so get off of me
I'm not slowing the softening

No apologies, nah suckers I'm not sorry
You can all sue me; y'all could be the cause of me
No apologies, y'all feeling the force of me
No remorse for me, like there was no recourse (nah) for me
No apologies, not even acknowledging you at all
Till I get a call that God's coming
No apologies, laugh fuckers, its all funny
I can spit in your face while you're standing across from me
No apologies

My head hits the pillow, a weeping willow
I can't sleep, a pain so deep it bellows
But these cellos, help just to keep me mellow
Hands on my head, touch knees to elbows
I'm hunched over emotion just flows over
These cold shoulders are both frozen
You don't know me
I keep saying it, I can't stress it enough
So keep playing it, and stand next to the subs
I choke mics like affixation
When I'm strangling my own throat masturbating
Fuck yeah I'm a basket case
And I mastered this rap shit till my ass gets wasted
Till my assassination, till I'm slain cuz of some fags infatuation
.44 Mag's fascination a taste for disaster and if that's the case then

No apologies, nah suckers I'm not sorry
You can all sue me; y'all could be the cause of me
No apologies, y'all feeling the force of me
No remorse for me, like there was no recourse (nah) for me
No apologies, not even acknowledging you at all
Till I get a call that God's coming
No apologies, laugh fuckers it's all funny
I could spit in your face while you're standing across from me
No apologies

This song isn't for you it's for me
A true MC, it's what he'll do
Just to see if he still has it
And if his skills mastered
He's able to spill raps long after he's killed that's a
Real MC got you feeling me
Whether willing or unwillingly, you still agree
As long as there's still this hunger, and will in me
Then expect a longer life expectancy
I'd be a savage beast if I ain't had this outlet to salvage me
Inside, I'd be exploding soaked in self loathing
And mourning so I'm warning you don't coax me
It's silly, but really its sheep in wolves clothing
Who only reacts when he gets pushed don't be
fooled, the press blows up this whole thing
It's stupid, they don't know cuz they don't see
That I'm wounded, all they did was ballooned it
I'm sick of talking bout these tattoos Cartoon did
That's why I tuned it OUT I'm sick of duking
They can suck my dick while I'm puking, and you too you can

Expect no sympathy from me
I'm an MC, this is how I'm supposed to be
Cold as a G, my hearts frozen it don't even beat
So expect no apologies
Expect no sympathy from me
I'm an MC, this is how I'm supposed to be
Cold as a G, my hearts frozen it don't even beat
So expect no apologies

[Master P - Verse 1] 
I'ma hustler, baller, nigga G'z and cut ki's 
Gats for enemies, freeze! hundred degreez 
Kill, robbery, soldier- born to ride 
Killer- born to die, Mama- was born to cry 
Wild like a long fuckin' ranger 
Niggaz from the South keep one up in the chamber 
Lord knows, when your enemy is quittin' 
That's why niggaz watchin' nigga's back, 
cause they gone on that powder shit 
Caine, nigga's gang, heroin in the vain 
Fuckin' with they brains 
Who the next nigga to get popped by a cop? 
Who the next nigga in the hood to get shot? 
I hope it ain't me, so I'm strapped up in bulletproof 
Nigga on my stomach see - Motherfuckin' T.R.U. 
Soldier til I die, fuck it I won't cry 
Look my ENEMY, in the eye 
Fuck every nigga that ain't real, cause we bout it 
And if I have to die, cause a nigga gone shout it 
I was born a No Limit Soldier, from heart 
Cowards run they mouth, but killers don't talk

[Master P - Verse 2] 
You know Kriss, I'm Kross

No Limit niggaz got ghetto dope by pounds and bults 
Blowin' tapes up in flames, like weed 
Got box albums up like ki's, from the South to overseas 
Niggaz independant, and rowdy 
Nigga check billboard, number 1 and bout it 
That's why niggaz tryin' to get us on the radio 
Now niggaz might see the P. on the video 
But a nigga, still TRU to the Gizzame 
Cause I, represent the hood and every fuckin' nigga that gangbang 
The streets is so real, fool guard yo grill 
Smoke one for the homies that done made it over the hill 
Cause we.....

Nigga I went from riches to riches 
Not motherfuckin' rags to riches

Nigga runnin' from the po po's, hidin' from a lo lo' 
Takin' trips together to the ??? 
Fa'sho though, puttin' a vest up under my Polo 
Nigga strapped with the 4 when I'm solo 
To test the best, then that's a no no 
365 days, 24/7, I'm bout my riches 
See money, is a must, everything's a plus, includin' weed and bitches 
It went from 18/5 a ki, not 18/5 for me, C and P to do a show 
Act like y'all know, Ghetto Millionaire,

Typed by: Cno Evil

[Intro: Hell Razah]
Uh, chea, bang 'em up, Bang Bang
Hell Razah, touch these niggas' heart, Bang

[Suga Bang Bang]
I don't think you really wanna come around here
None of my homies play that game around here
Eyeing before the day break out
Quick to take it to the streets, and get it on
Anywhere, I don't care, you know my barrier
This is how we do things, shoot 'em up, bang bang
Young desperado, know it be Apollo
Tell your boys get low, pimping ain't easy
Ya'll get up off me, mmm-hmm

[Hell Razah]
We getting rich like a spaceship, we love AK clips
Give ease to the Playboy chicks
You can't blow when you hate on men, sit back, wait on men
With fork tongue snaking they friends
In the hood, it's against all odds, you spit 16 bars
Fast money and them luxury cars
I was formed in the image of God, not material
Still stay strapped with the scratched off serial
Black Sinatra, with a pocket full of miracle
Yeah I got ears, and I still ain't feeling you
Back with the hood on smash, rock a gold Ghetto Government mask
And a Dead President to match

[Killah Priest]
The Devil's diary, I left fingerprints on the prince
The Joker, laughing Two-Faces and walk with a limp
My holster, under my armpit, millenium garments
Arabic fabrics, while smoking up the bones of Mohammed
Blowing out the smoke of opression, holding my weapon
Hairs came from the robe of a peasant, touch my heart
Priest see white bodies in the dark, soon as my ink touch my King Tut
Between us is the pen, I write gems, the viking, see my white wings
My sword of blind justice, I love my nine brothers

[Tash Mahogany]
Third rail, cut the power, we got a problem
Is this chick Mahogany, a little livewire?
I tend the wildfire, I cause a jaw wired
On any MC who staying up and act tired
I got alotta G's in my mob, I got alotta cheese and a job
Niggas think they leave and I slob, til they see me leave in a Saab
Zoom 22's out the drive, Grand Theft Auto kinda live
You oughta move aside, hit me on my Motorola Sky
My, jeepers, creepers, I bang out the speakers
I glide through the mic like the late season sneakers
Then run that back like lampers and sneakers
I shut down MC's from the court to the bleachers
With more butter, I got some more butter bangers
I have the game chipped like mommy dearest with some hangers
Y'all Crank Yankers, you didn't know that I was dangerous
MC's don't be discouraged, come again, don't be a stranger

[Hurricane G]
Aiyyo son, you have the right to remain silent
Even though you ain't did NOTHIN violent
So Hurricane G spit this, rip this
Straight out the poorest congressional district
The Bronx baby, shit is crazy!
I see my niggaz get harassed daily
183rd you heard, got it locked
But shit is hot, we got choppers on the spot
Watched off rooftops, from WAY up the block
My niggaz be like, "FUCK the cops!"
And face the consequences
Risk bein beat, killed, and arrested
Sentenced, forced to live between wire fences
It's a FUCKED UP AGENDA
Whether cop a plea or surrender
If you'se a three time drug offender
you goin DOWN son
for way less than a POUND son
The government got no love, twenty-five thousand niggaz
in New York in jail for drugs
And three million in the streets is thugs
What, the, FUCK?!

[?]
Aiyyo I drop gems sporadic, it ain't democratic
My demographic, ain't tryin to feel no type of static
But still can't escape from Jake
From one-six-eight, to over the bridge, outta state
It's hate, tryin to relate, the violation
Annihilation, on all different type of nation
Word life, it's like the third reich, you heard right
Pulled me over on the turnpike, plus my birthright thwarted
by the government supported
Court ordered, good lawyer?  I can't afford it
Sound distorted, I don't be where the wealthy be
So they got a cell for me and act unhealthily
But I got somethin that they all should check
N.Y.C., P.N.P., up on your set

	"Blowin down your motherfuckin roof.."
You watch us, we watch you
You stop us, we stop you
[G]	You goin DOWN son!
We watch you.. we stop you..
[G]	DOWN son!  For way less than a POUND son!

[Hurricane G]
Shit!  Seven hundred million tax dollars a year
to keep drug dealers in prison
While the rapists and the killers is livin
Deep in the streets chillin, shit is real!
Niggaz rape little girls for a thrill
and the rest kill for a MEAL
While fifty percent of women in prison, is on death row
But that shit is on the low, for murderin a spouse
or lover, abusive motherfuckers!
It don't make no sense!
Why, the women go down over self-defense
and spend, seventeen hours a day
in the cell, a.k.a., a living hell
with low level standards, fuckin BASTARDS
Got me devestated and offended
for wrongfully mistreatin females who pregnant
who can't exercise the rights of first amendment
All my peoples stop pretendin
and get yours to the endin!

[?]
Aiyyo, peep statistics, we official in the districts
Sadistic, tryin to keep the black fist twisted
Find the flaw, shinin scars behind iron bars
Crime laws not designed to fight no kind of wars
Let it sink in (they send you) straight to Sing-Sing
(Doors are kicked in) kingpins flee to Kingston
Life in exile, projectile for the reptile
Cruel machines use human beings as a textile
For the darkest race, there's no escape
from the marketplace, no grace if you caught a case
It interest me, how one of the most watched indices
of economic growth is prison industries
If Gods ain't locked, no jobs for cops
If blocks ain't hot, stock options drop
From Boston to Brooklyn, my heads is gettin tooken
I win when the crooks win (WE OUT) bring the hook in

	"Blowin down your motherfuckin roof.."
	"Blowin down your motherfuckin roof.."
We stop you..

Song:   North 2 Tha South
Typed by: Lil Hustle

(*talking*)
Whoa yeah, Lil' Flip the Freestyle King
Hold up, from the North to the South
Uh, uh, uh

[Lil' Flip]
Welcome to the South, where niggaz ride 84 swangas
Nothing but the screwed shit, in they c.d. changers
You know me, as I slide down the block
Nothing but princess cuts, slide off my watch
As I slide out my block, sipping Sprite syrup
Wearing Iceberg, bout to hit the right curb
I might swerve, when I'm under the influence
They pull me over, but I got my license and insurance
You know me, as I'm on six-ten
In a big Benz, swangas poke like stick-ends
Riding on chrome, with my Prime Co. phone
I'm the Freestyle King, cause I'm sitting on my throne
The Southside, we ride down MLK
The Southside, turn three lanes to a one way
The Southside, you gon get some gun play
Hands in my pants, but my name ain't Al Bun-day

[Hook: Chamillionaire]
It ain't a game, we switching lanes
Sitting on D's or swangs, gripping and squeezing grain
See me, I ain't ashamed to throw up the set I claim
It's a Northside Southside, Dirty South thang

[Chamillionaire]
We on lights that got word, choppers on block 'burbs
Make sure that you lock your, Denali's and droppers
Got nuts and got nerds, if you caught without your
Heat in your boxers, no feathers they got birds
Man I'm sitting crooked on a switch, and your misses wondering
If she'd freeze her lips, if she kissed my wrist
Top of the list top gun, tops for the drop got none
Where they pop Don pop gun, and run when the cops come
That's where I'm from, shrangle a grain swanging a lane where I hang
Everyday thang, ducking the FED's busting the lead screens hang
Nothing but rain, me and Lil' Twin always been like kin
So we spend six to ten, six-ten crooked on sixteen
Throw up your set and represent, like you ain't ashamed of it
If you see me with a case, then I promise it ain't luggage
You still on the same subject, and spitting the same rubbish
Chamillion just came thuggish, don't act like you can't love it

[Hook: Chamillionaire]

[Paul Wall]
My neighborhood mean-mug, cause we be acting a grouch
20 inches squatting lower, than a midget that crouch
We leaning with a slouch, on a European made couch
I'm a walking night club, cause there's a disco ball in my mouth
You better not come out the house, if you afraid of the dark
My advice is not to park your car, next to the park
And if you ain't got no bite, then you better not bark
Cause on my block, you'll be like raw meat surrounded by sharks
Hold up, them Hollywood hooligans at it again
If you owe nine, your best bet's to bring back ten
Me and Twin hitting licks, way up in Memphis 10
Go to sleep at 9:59, back on the grind at ten
Look out, I got a snowstorm on every tooth
I got clumsy screens that stumble, and fall down from the roof
Paul Wall act a guerilla, when it come to my loot
If you's a hater kiss my boot, till you puke it ain't cute

[Hook: Chamillionaire]

[Slim Thug]
Last but not least, off the Northside streets
Be the Mr. Slim Thug, the Boss capish
You wanna hustle on my block, you gotta ask for permission
Break the rules on my block, and you'll come up missing
Ain't no games being played, just big money getting made
You come short on that North, and somebody getting sprayed
We real G's no fakers, balling like the Lakers
By any means necessary, we getting paper
Not in the Rap-A-Lot mafia, but I roll with a mob
I cash a check everyday, but I ain't got no job
I'm a hustler a thug nigga, born and raised
If I don't get nothing else, Slim don't get paid
Nawfside representer, wrist cold like the winter
Main attraction when I enter, standing tall like a center
Boss Hogg representer, from the North to the South
H-Town to D-Town, we break boys off uh

Yeah yeah yeah this is going out to all the norteno homeboys 
Putting it down for they town you know what IM saying 
San fran mishone putting it down Moussie drop that shit homeboy 
SHHHAAAAYOOOOO! 

(Moussie) 
Young g's in my hood try to come up 
Quick to pull the trigger by the next man he don't give a fuck 
He's on a mission trying to stack a grip red rag on his hip 
And a Glock with an extended clip 
So just incase the fuck jumps got to keep a strap 
Cuz nowadays mutherfuckers try to peel your cap 
So he wants to put in work and earn a couple stripes 
Rollin in the stolen he has intention to take a life 
19th and lex 10 scraps try to plex again 
So now somebody's Mom got to wear a black dress again 
Hit the corner yelled out Norte Puto 
Then came the Glock stuck out the window 
He kept up until he emtied out the whole clip 
That's why these blue rag fags up in body bags 
No remorse he laughed when that foo fell 
No revenge his homies wanna go and tell 
But he aint know punched the gas he had his fun 
Drove to the hood to tell the homies bout the shit he done 
Meanwhile the scraps were at the station snitching 
Gave a description 5-0 searching through the mission 
Suprise next morning opened up his eyes 
Guns and badges blue suits and white guys 
Sounds kinda fucked up but homie would've told ay 
He's living out the life of a nourished soldier 

(chorusX2) 
In the northside this is how we ride 
red rags do or die scraps better run and hide 

(Mousse) 
Yo trip when you first let the pistol smoke 
But waking up in the county aint no joke 
That's murder one cause the crime was premeditated 
He thought it out on the trigger never hesitated 
Cuffed and booked you fate is now sealed 
And 30 with a L is the DA's first deal 
You ask your self what the fuck kind of deal is that 
With that much time there aint no chance I'll ever make it back 
Without a doubt not guilty was the youngsters plead 
Put the decision in the hands of a jury 
A bunch of scraps climbed up to the witness stand 
Fingers pointing when the judge said who's the man 
Is he seated in the courtroom here today 
The D. A smiled when they pointed at him right away 
They want to handle it by climbing in the witness seat 
Instead of getting strapped and holding court in the street 
In killa kali all the snitches get the 86 
An unidentified corpse in a shallow ditch 
Deliberation by the jury took about a day 
A guilty verdict meant a long ass prison stay 

(chorus X3) 

(Moussie) 
Rollin up San Quentin C.D.C reception 
Got over 10 sit that ass up in carses section 
Waiting on a chain to take you to your first pen 
Don't give a fuck because he'll never see the streets again 
He's on a gray goose hunt to his first joint 
A level four cause little homie got a gang of points 
Set him down in pelican bay with a gang of scraps 
B. R keep a strap and always watch your back 
Northside soldier put that work in for that X4 
You take out one of ours were taking out 10 of yours 
Don't got no nines got no Glock got to AK's 
But for keeps is the only way the norte plays 
Red rag to the heart so fuck the rest 
San Francisco mission district tatted on his chest 
Stroll in the yard with the homies sipping coffee 
Twisting up a Rolley get inglesia from an o. g 
And that's the way the game goes no its not a tragedy 
A four corner hell has turned into reality 
Sounds kind of fucked up but homey would have told you 
He's living out the life of a northside soldier 

(chorus X4) 

(talking) 
Shayoo 
Yeah that was just one mutherfucking daily ride through the northside 
I want to say wassup to all my homies up on c street

Intro: BizMarkie

C'mon
Break it down
Rarrraaaahahhhh!!
What happened?  C'mon!!
What happened??  Ahhrrrahhh!!
Rrrrah!
Now we got me
My man Chubb Rock over this Prince Paul beat
Yo Chubb you start it off we gonna freak it
C'mon

Verse One: Chubb Rock

Here we go
To the consumer, and the kids who drop rumors
For the man who sport, Timberland and dash suede Pumas
I, come backwards on stuff you don't deny
If you try to act fly then I'll, punk you I and I
When, I turn my ducats into Li Pao Yen
The gas from the past of the American friend
With your suits and your squads and your fancy car
Turn to bourgeoise, to invade the media, shame
Take it insult, call me, the Grape Ape
When I flow people gotta see the whole Ricki Lake
Ate, every cuisine and scheme from Jamaica
I like Spike Lee's a kind of sporty 40 Acre
I gotta have it, O.J., he gotta stab it
Stop dealin with that Cato Caelin kid, the drug addict
If you missed me, don't kiss me with the tongue
Soon to come is my man BizMark the one

Verse Two: BizMarkie

La-dah-di, la-dah-da, I like to say
you know me, as the inhuman orchestra
When you first heard me I did MEOW MEOW
Guaranteed to rock and shock and clock and
oh, I made you say ow yes
You hear me rockin, you hear me clockin
You hear people jockin
Is it because I'm like smart like Mr. Spock and
Captain Kirk and, you know I'm workin
I'm bound to wreck your body, go OWWW, I go bezerk and
You always hearin, you always clearin, you always cheerin
Hey, umm, umm I'm dissapearin like Magic
I'm tragic, all of a sudden
You Gotta Have It like Spike Lee, hey, you know me
as the Uh-riginal B, I-Z, the M, the A
The ickaZarR-Kay, I-E
I'm not diggedy Das EFX but I can mic check it
The original, here to rock and get respected
I'm Markie, heh, the M-ahh-Zay-R-Kay
The man appointed rap King, and I'm here to stay
I'm down to wreck your body, I'm not here to scrub
I gotta pass it over, to my man Chubb

Verse Three: Chubb Rock

From the glass clear era that's the point of the one
Be unique, critique, from the crumb, me neva done
I check them then wreck them let them fall into my spectrum
Then the Punky Brewster kids they, squeeze like rectum
I become monolithic then rip it the remains I sip it
My hat I tip it, cheerio, kid and here I go
Off beat slackin, but the platinum mediocre rappers
with the corporate backers interfused to grab sag actors
The, acoustic suits it, the boys juiced it then boost it
It kinda Gravedigs, well it should, Prince Paul produced it
What about bourgeoise, super star, in unleaded fuel cars
Hangin in bars, talkin the trife squads
Girls buckwild, child, in the rub-a-dub style
Every girl love oh Chubb Rock profile, smile
At the camera point your gluttimus to the man
At the movie star to smack out, with my rubber band
I can tell that, you need me, you don't want me to get paunchy
And me, I don't want to catch no HIV
So we'll protect you, and me but mainly me
If you don't want no rubber then P-E-A-C-E

[Mr. Skurge]
My weapons of elimination
Dispersed first and of the earth
To say goodbye
The sound of war doves cry
Bring a controled urine
And tears for I
Open the amount of drought
Days run dry
But my focus is like raining
Rappers decapitating gods
Move slow with the
Eye on prize
Not worried about the other
Shotguns, fruits of my labor
Soon to be sun-dried or deep-fried
Whichever one hurts more
I'm still to decide
Homeboys and beats will be denied
No eat to the days
No room to get high
(pump motherfucker) The sky's the limit
I rethought my situation I'm not ready to die
Like the late great even though
I think about it half-baked sitting on my bedside
Sometimes suicide
I realized the mission ain't
Over me, a covert commander
Search for infinite
Till the time they read miranda rights
These days he roams free
Waiting to get one in his sights
Maybe one day
My radio or gun play
Until that day
We stay beneath the surface
Everyone stay beneath the surface
Everyday every one day everyone say

[Chorus] - (2X)
All snakes bite even though
All poisons don't affect you
I seen to many anxious rappers
Grabbing mics like homosexuals
Grab dicks I prick my finger
Made the blood oh...
We toasted Hip Hop a long time ago
It ain't no secret

The beacon was visible
I came to the light thinking that being invisible
Might do some things that make our parents proud
Thought should have been broadcasted out loud
Now I wear a shroud of anger plus I'm a little stranger
Now that I'm used to being a pest
I haven't lost my sene of direction
Or found my place at last
Spending time in my room
Pouring out thoughts on pads
Like a chemist with a flask
Designing a drink
To cure my own self-affliction
Turn to grim affliction
If you got some beef meet me at the benediction
Until then keep slivering
And I'll keep wishing

[Chorus] - (1X)

Song:   Nothing to Lose
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I've been living my life
But it isn't fair
Woulda never thought I'd be
Down in this gutter

If I can make it here
I can make it anywhere
When the going gets tough
I've gotta get tougher

Sometimes you only get one shot
I've gotta give it all I got

Cause I ain't got nothing to lose
So much to prove
I get to far to hear no
Gotta go hard or go home
I ain't got nothing to lose
I gotta do what I gotta do

No I ain't got nothing

Oh, how the hell did my back
Get against the wall
Never thought that I would
Be here at rock bottom

At least I don't
Have to worry
About the phone
Why did I end up
With 99 problems

Sometimes you only get one shot
I've gotta give it all I got

Cause I ain't got nothing to lose
(I ain't got nothing)
So much to prove
(I got so much to prove to you)
I get to far to hear no
Gotta go hard or go home
I ain't got nothing to lose
I gotta do what I gotta do
I ain't got nothing

[Chorus]
Tell me like it is, is
And not like it was
Tell me like it is, is
And not like it was

[repeat Chorus]

[Snoop Dogg]
I give a panel to my man with my right hand
I roll a blunt with my left hand
Give it to the best man
Testing, testing one-two
Do you hear what I'm talkin bout
Am I coming through (come on)
Big Snoopy sky sushi
Don't fuck wit a broad
Unless she kickin in the koochie
Like the big homie Moochie
He say sport Snoop Dogg Clothing
Fuck Gucci
I gotta keep it true see
A lotta niggaz talk shit but wont do shit to me
Catch me on the streets
Or catch me in the club
Or catch me on the screen
Or catch me if you can
Or catch me wit a hundred thousand in my hand
Catch me chillin' in a C-boy stance
Or hangin' in the hood doin a C-Walk dance

[Chorus]

[Soopafly]
Yeah, uh huh
C'mon
Yeah
Well ok
Now let me break it heat for ya
Tell ya how it went
I'ma really tell ya why these bitches ain't shit
I let a hoe get close and get em watch close
All up in my house though
I was diggin out, yeah
Baby want to feel with Soopa really all about me
How I'm livin' good and other niggaz in a drought, huh
How I got these biggas feelin' like they wanna shout me
How I get my cap out my six-four, bounce
How I'm fresh, clean with eleven hoes on my team
Runnin' they thoughts and runnin' most of they dreams
Sometimes call me daddy
Sometimes king
Hold my thing
Don't fuck wit my rings
Keep my make-up off them jeans

[E. White]
I stay holdin' my nuts in
Runnin' my trap in
Showin' these sluts wots happening
Oh yeah I used to get wet up
Throw a set up
Act loud all night wouldn't shut up
But I'm high with the Dogg, nigga what up
And that's the homie Soopafly muthafucker
Somethin I been wantin to say to y'all niggas
That's speak on me and the homies that roll wit us
Some real hard hitters
We live in churches and so we keep God with us
We got the narrator R wit us
And the home boy Kokane oh boy it's on again, come on

[Chorus]

[RBX]
Narrator hit 'em wit the flash blood flow
Bitch nigga drown in the under tow
We chop the spot like thunder though
Bitch niggaz step in will blunder bro
Let me tell y'all how it really is
X down with Snoop it ain't no quiz
From me Aaliyah mo thicker than water
Once missiles are launched mo quicker the slaughter
Bloody murder
Got to do it, strike back with a vengeance, thought y'all knew
In the past tense, done did it
Catch you slip in the club you done shit it
Admit it, we blaze a trail
Without us on your team you'll fail
Me n Soopa doop, my nigga E-White

Bitches jock all night
We gang-bang

Song:   Nothing But a Number
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I'm living in the public eye
Here camera, there camera, I ain't never lie
We can't even be alone, they wanna take a peak
Baby even though I'm loving life it could be a bitch
I guess things are getting serious got a new bae
And it's a fiasco I ain't talking Lupe
Hear the b.s. go I'm doing my best though
If I care about what they said
Why would you be here for?

She keep huffing and puffing
you be thinking and I'm bluffing
You get mad and holla back
And that's the end of discussion
Now everybody's a critic plus I'm sitting with pretty
Play it cool out in the streets
When you get home you gon get it

Cause age ain't nothing but a number
Age ain't nothing but a number
If we don't add up we could subtract
It don't matter we'll be right back
Cause age ain't nothing but a number
The older the berry the sweeter the juice
The older the berry the sweeter the juice

She do it like a model, she rock designer labels
We always popping bottles I let her rob the craddle
They all say she a cougar I hope they take me to the zoo
I tell her play it cooler and this is what she do

She keep huffing and puffing
you be thinking and I'm bluffing
You get mad and holla back
And that's the end of discussion
Now everybody's a critic plus I'm sitting with pretty
Play it cool out in the streets
When you get home you gon get it

Cause age ain't nothing but a number
Age ain't nothing but a number
If we don't add up we could subtract
It don't matter we'll be right back
Cause age ain't nothing but a number
The older the berry the sweeter the juice
The older the berry the sweeter the juice
The older the berry the sweeter the juice
The older the berry the sweeter the juice

I want the beat to come in, aaah
Wha-wha-whoa-whoa-whoa

Chorus:

He said "It's poppin at the club"
Ya rollin down the strip on dubs

Got em knee deep with the freak now what what what

Pay attention from the top my nigga
Figure it out, Capricorn is here to turn shit out
Sexy motherfucker, bells ring, cap the dog
Out the penal into the club, clear the smoke screen
Hottie revival, check the routine
I rip shit from Cali to Queens, doin my thang nahmean?
??? tone gon' handle the voice prone
Well-connected, underworld ties, to each his own
I play my park control zone, let it be known
Baby girl rockin them world, wit the strips on
Heady eyes, no surprise, I stay fly
Caught this nigga peepin me out, a wiseguy
He was mackin and I was mackin back
Invisionin some shit we would do if laid flat
Meet me at the bar, so we can parlay
Thug Pass' action wit Cris, fuck Alize

Chorus (x2)

Damn
Twisted sex style so they empty me
Seven figure sent deals like fees you pay for me
My nigga need the 4 G's, smoke the ill trees
Scope Gabbana C's, ya bout the 8-50, bitch please
Be attitude cos he don't know you, tight rule
Keep the balance on line, for those who been confused, nigga
Cross thoughts, do it wrong he rules, baby boy
Heavy in game, he play, you lose
How Do U Want It? I'm askin you like Pac
And if ya askin me well man I like it on the top
Hot like fire, natural born killer for hire
Covered like Esquire the liar
Easy like your shire, send yo ass to blues wrong
I'm like that long calm beauty, I got the strong arm
There's no ???? shit, you crossed me wrong
Hot sex live on set, checkmate the pawn/porn

Chorus (x2)

Double-bed, wolfin this, we right back
Willy out, superstar clout, I cover your points Brett
Enemies is infrared, that's how I see em
Sayin some shit I said I didn't mean, you cats believe em
Only a man I fucked em, hauled ass and trucked em
Said he liked it my way and so I stuck him
For the cash wit my bitch ass, but he liked dat
He must cos he keep on comin right back

Chorus (x2)

Outro:

He said "It's poppin at the club"
Capricorn, y'all ain't ready for me
Y'all ain't fuckin me, y'all can't do it like me
Comin from the Westside
Got em knee deep with the freak now what what what
And all the bitches and all the niggas
And everybody knee deep in the game
Don't be a dumb nigga in the game nigga
Got em knee deep with the freak now what what what

"No talent"- scratched
Intro:
Ha ha it's going down right now. The proceeds from Grouch's album is going 
out to charity. Ha ha. Grouch ain't to racer! What? Saver! Aye peep this 
right here.

Mr. Goliath:
The light was on upstairs we was unprepared for the next event
But the circumstance left a cool sense of surprise 
Eyes widen up 
When some speakers with talons raise the mic in the clutch
Right smack in the middle 
Bumpin' all we continue with a smigget of patients to deliver 
Follow these messages translated aided by a flow so similar to lettin' 
yourself go freely on the stand still
Patients wearing thin
But we wait so we don't hate
Slow Rollin' through the Yay
As we raise fine art through the origin hip hop
Undoubtedly 
Raising through the top to be fresh equals me and my crew
the best way to kick it and forget about the blues about not being on TV 
Summon up the skills are comin' up and summon all thoughts of creativity 
Testin' your vacinity

Grouch:
I heard that good things come to those who wait
But I hate lackin' ass dead time like a line with no bait
And I be sittin' at the dock of the Bay fiendin' for mics
Dreamin' of nights where wishes come true
And the bitches come through 
With new Nikes are worn and warm meals are served with ANY form of MC
Who had the bit of nerve but I observe that's not the case 
At every time and place
I ask the future for the answer to the question that I face
I had a place called contentment but the rent was too high
Got evicted from that shit now I'm bent through the sky
I spy
My patents like the enemy (enemy)
It's like a nation that pretends to be down until you turn around
I yearn for sounds of bliss so risk you can't ignore them
Anymore men who listen 
The smoother my mission flows 
Addiction grows like seeds as my need to achieve (feed me)
I take a rest after the leave (leave)

Hook: (x2)
Freely in the standstill 
Patients wearing thin
So we wait but we don't 
So we ain't slow rollin' through the Yay
As we raise fine art through this origin hip hop

Eligh:
Sending gifts of understanding to those not understood
Except those faggot ass MCs now interpretations is good
That's how I'm living that's my understanding unchanged 
Or deranged by the city no matter how strange
My gauge is knocking full speed full throttle
Bust a bottle on the concrete it's that's long lasting anger
Casting shadows over strangers 
In front of Blondes I slang tapes 
Or at least attempt knowing nobodies exempt
>From being broke 
Me and a smoker I need loot for support getting the boot
When I fish the lake no permanent residence so I partake on a search 
A bird with out a perch
Specifically a crow lost in the hot snow
No nest, no money to invest 
Scraping wood chips doused with no resin mostly sess
A little bit less then happy, I keep my penmanship on point
I said what I meant keeping to fingers on the joint

Sunspot Jones:
Wake, up, FOOL! (look look)
Do you rip out a shit or not?
I ain't got no time to listen do you miss your four promo?
Oh no don't make me get live 
Half those arrogant DJs got our shit but don't play it
Leavin' underground and MCs feelin' mad and a little underrated 
I hated givin' a DJ my shit
But organize he wanna ride the East coast dick (get off they...!)
That's why I stop goin' Crugges eatin' Crisco (put your hands lay down)
That's why I never kiss no ass to bump my single
No naw
They be like "y'all is worldwide
Can I be your DJ?" (huh?)
And I think back to when your bitch made ass wouldn't give me no play in the 
Bay
Until you saw us kickin' it in Rap Page (oh)
A rocket swingin' outta your bottles in Monte Carlo 
You started, jock, see we
Control our destiny 
Well those fools is scared to see you be frontin' in the bar
Ridin' in your partner car
Talkin' bout shit you never gonna do
35, broke but cool 
Walkin' your baby daughter to school
Beeotch
(and that ain't even your baby) 
Gimmie my. 
Get out my way (ha ha)

Hook

Murs:
Now 99 these motherfuckers out now don't know shit about sellin' they own tape
But give these niggas a deal they bad as Superman without the cape
Wait 
When the album don't get bought and the label drop your ass
"Drop"- Beastie Boys
You find out you wasn't as fly as you thought
Caught ground zero another hometown hero turn has been 
While me and my crew just look at your ass then laugh then 
Throw your tape out the window on the freeway 
We finish the night countin' our money from sellin' tapes the G way 
And that's tax free
Now if you ask me 
All you signed motherfuckers need to attend underground college
And under me attain the knowledge on how to properly MC
I'm watchin' Rap City, MTV waitin' for someone to ring the gong
Yeah that video is hella fresh but it ain't got shit to do with your song
Now all these crews will never know the meaning of payin' dues
But claimin' they mastered the lessons
But then they holdin' a drink and a mic in the other hand 
Become the meaning of stage presence
And backstage can't protect you from the rage of this teenage wonder
Make you state your name break and serial number
Before I put you under 
And add another stripe to the cult
See I sniped you through the throat will full metal jacket tactics
Cultivated on the streets of mid city LA 
Where niggas don't play that 
You said that on the album you better live it
Or give that shit a rest 
I'm tired of you motherfuckers not gettin' put to the test
And I'm not believing' that you sockin' niggas in the face just for breathing
Deceiving' the blind throwin' out swine
To all these starvin' mind 
And you'll find none in which you can compare me
Cause I ain't done shit unless it's Legendary
Bitch

Song:   Nubians in Devistated Places
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Infinito 2017]
I'm like truth supplied in a fictional world
Where a man got the nerve to dress up like a girl
Under earth like Shambala, well versed in who I am
Step on you like Watusi, Big Shaq types
Enter this world like meteorites, aight? Spoken word
Slap a government official, no I don't like Bush
Ishtar studyin socialized reading all books
Looks can be deceiving I'm like, triple darkness
You see me as a black hole, youths teleported
Your time machine will not help you travel like a Hebrew, sham me down
You doing Hinduish devil worship
Cats see me with George P-Funk Parliament, I'm a soul man
And I know man, walking tornado, stop sucking my air in
The Garden of Eden, Adamites of the 24 elders
Greeting known today as cloning
Black people spend what they don't have to buy what they don't need, uh

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Complication, this is my application
Breaking the spell, of the United Nations
Through procreation, watch the planet's devistation
As I continue on you face your annihilation

[Infinito 2017]
Nonchalant, narcotic free, never lost
RIght here in touch with reality
Music to me is artistic, catch the half time, turned up twisted
Countering the conspiracy to destroy black boys listen
To the trade news on {?} and see how words can become
an outlet for creativity, unorthodox for society
The sky doesn't have to distort his voice to show prison
Excellent appearance and knew the city of the sun
Check the scrolls from lower to upper Egypt
With an eye all-seeing never blind
Crossed the Nile River with something of importance
Too much slang to pronounce everythang
Y'all hate on me because I don't throw on a out-of-town accent
to make a new song, to make a new song, to make a new song
To make a new song, to make a new song, to make a new song
To make a new song, to make a new song, to make a new, song
Yeah, uh-huh

Mr. Officer, Mr. Officer
Why do you wanna see me in a coffin, sir?
Mr. Officer, Mr. Officer
I don't wanna be layin a coffin, sir
No, no, no

[El Dorado]
It's the police, comin straight from the underground
A young brotha got it bad cuz I'm brown
You wonder why I can't get no peace, asleep
I'm makin more than the chief of police
I creep, on the plan, 20 inch rims
You gon' always have haters when you're havin divadins
Here come the po-po, still roll slow mo'
About to blow some hydro inside a optimo
The president choke and smoke on the sticky
I told this fool I'm rappin, why he pattin on my Dickies?
Next'll be me, cuz I'm a teenager
With a little bit of platinum and a pager
Tappin my phone, lookin for the product
Thinkin every balla is servin narcotics
You rather G, me in a ?
Than me rollin in a 300 and 300 Benz
She never knew what hit her
Beans pulled the trigger
I lost another nigga
Pour out a little liquor

[Michel'le]
Mr. Officer, Mr. Officer
I don't wanna be layin a coffin, sir
Mr. Officer, Mr. Officer
I don't wanna be layin a coffin, sir

Mr. Officer, Mr. Officer
Why did you wanna see me in a coffin, sir?
Mr. Officer, Mr. Officer
I don't wanna be layin a coffin, sir
No, no oh

[Captain Save M']
You know I heard some disturbing news, a situation
Heard about them panelopie po-po's actin bad across the nation
There's a particular situation that got me feelin sad
It had the whole family askin God, why did it happen?
Young and innocent, it gets so tense, is what I mention
Never had the chance to live out a lifelong dream before it ended
They say we shouldn't fade a white man's laws, at all times
Whatever dude, the po-po's always have somethin else in mind
I was ridin in a Caddy 500, bumpin Will Smith, gettin jiggy
When I looked up in the rearview and spotted - Damn, it's a piggy
License suspended, warrant checks, verbal altercation
Officer Dolittle, ????????
JuJu's and Wam-Wam's is all we had to work with, chancin & hollerin
Wish I had the chance to screw the marbles and hire Johnny Cochran
I'm just a black man in this white man's world, like 'Pac say
Wassup y'all, shouldn't play, cuz we can't save 'em from the yay

[Michel'le]
Mr. Officer, Mr. Officer
Why do you wanna see me in a coffin, sir?
Mr. Officer, Mr. Officer
I don't wanna be layin a coffin, sir (save me)

Mr. Officer, Mr. Officer
Why do you wanna see me in a coffin, sir?
Mr. Officer, Mr. Officer
I don't wanna be layin a coffin, sir (why do you wanna see me)
Oh no, no

We ain't sayin that all cops are bad
I think the good cops hate the bad cops sometimes
But you know this has to stop
You feel me?

[El Dorado]
Ebony, heavenly, sent from up above
Blessed me with my flesh, that's respect with love
Hey ballas, this brotha spiked the set-backs
They only around to get you down, so don't sweat that
Let that, a change gon' come
Reminiscin the days of old when all the negros sunk
It don't matter where you're from
They still do what's bad
Walkin with a stack, got 'em lookin for my rag
I dash from the police, arrest resisted
Apprehend my shin, to the pen is the mission
You wonder why I'm trippin (don't trip, stay cool)
They made me wanna act a fool, they way they shot up Boo
When too young, reduce a life to a gun
A flat tire cost you when you're livin in the slum
Make me wanna holla, the way they do my life
And it really ain't right

[Michel'le]
Mr. Officer, Mr. Officer
I didn't wanna be layin a coffin, sir
Mr. Officer, Mr. Officer
I don't wanna be layin a coffin, sir

Mr. Officer, Mr. Officer
Why did you wanna see me in a coffin, sir?
Mr. Officer, Mr. Officer
I don't wanna be layin a coffin, sir

So why do you do what you do? (why)
As we make the world go 'round (we make the world go 'round)
So why do you do what you do?
Because you know...
We make the world go 'round

So Mr. Officer (Mr. Officer)
Please Mr. Officer (oh please Mr. Officer)
Mr. Officer (please Mr. Officer)
Don't take my life, no no

Intro:
Alize
Hold on Nigga
No more gangsta shit
Nigga you know that gangsta shit put you on the map
So if you ain't gonna turn into somethin' new,
we gonna have to rewind the track
To way back

I was walkin' through the park one day
Puffin' on a bomb ass J (Come here with that weed Snoop)
See my Nigga suited blue-grey
This is what a Nigga had to say

Ohuuuuuuuh

Verse 1:
[Soopafly]
I was about 16 years old
Runnin the streets of Long Beach
Nigga, straight fuckin' up
Every party that I went to
I had to stuck a frame (Daz: Motherfucker)
For my name is Soopa, 
what the fuck you say
I think he saw the handle on my .44
When he get seated,
22 I was reachin' fo'
I show you how you do when shit blow up
1, 2, 3 it's that
Your party over Nigga
Move on to the next one
You should've brought a few mo' Niggas,
for some protection
You fuckin' with notorious ass G's
You never get passed these
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 think is that we straight dumpin'
That's why I'm always into somethin'
I faded, faded till that Nigga broke
To show that I ain't no motherfuckin' joke
? somethin' thought he could check me
But the guard sent his ass directly
Yo, to his G-R-A-V-E
Bein' stupid try to P-L-A-Y me
Yo, listen well to me,
spell it to the underground
Nobody playin' pussy
So I'm layin' it down
A little somethin' from the motherfuckin' DPG
Soopafly from O.G. 2 B.G.

Chorus: x2

A G is a overseer
A overseer sees

>From O.G. 2 B.G.

Verse 2:
[Kurupt Tha Kingpin]
The motherfuckin' game took a lot again
Aw shit, the streets is hot again
Protection down in 2 months
Rolled up with the homie Swoop a couple sluts
Let me call the homie now, Nigga
Phonecheck punk
I poke Niggas down
When I'm in the yard, the bar
The Niggas just angin' (Daz: Dogg Pound)
Pop when I get out I'm back bangin'
Rollin', I can't be helt no motherfuckin' mo' (Right)
As soon as I get out the motherfuckin' do' (Right)
Chevrolet, straight sittin' on low ? (Right)
Now it's on till it's on till the brake of dawn
Fuckin' with notorious ass G's
Nigga, punk, bitch please
>From gettin' quoted on the hood till packin'
Murders, slangin' and jackin'
I rather fuck you bitch
Now go tell your Nigga you made the right switch
My lesson is my ho, respect me
K-U-R-U-P-T from O.G. 2 B.G.

Chorus: x2

[Kurupt]
Daz Dilli is the gangsta, gangsta
Tell us about the days of way back

Verse 3:
[Daz Dillinger]
Slangin' cars, hangin' hard
Upon the boulevard
Gettin' stars as a young Nigga behind bars
My willy's dead, I fuck you fresh out the gate
I can't wait, demonstrate
Thought I was gone for all my old weight
Now I'm back with a Tec-9 and a Strap
And with that in my hart Nigga,
you know ain't no turnin' back
Called up Kurupt and Dr. Dre to load up the AK
Let's put some work on these Niggas, 
to let them know we don't play
Blew, Blew we scared around the corner
Creep on 'em, make a mil
To makin' all y'all goners
Ain't a rap from my shelf
It was no good times shit
A little Nigga puttin' dick
Niggas on their chest
All with a nitty 14
Was all what it seems
In cape of horrible dreams
Trapped, with a helluva machine
Quick to pistol till you tipple
Let you know, plan it simple
How back in my ? 
Bullets flyin' like missiles
So what's on and on
And as the way it should be
Motherfucker from O.G. 2 B.G.

(Dj Babu scratches "say what" while Rakka Irisciense
and Evidence say this intro):

Ah... uh, 
(Yeah), It's goin' down, yeah, yeah
Dilated, "Neighborhood Watch", what up
Everybody, BABU! it's Babu, yeah, yeah, yeah
OKAYPLAYER, of course

[Rakaa Iriscience]
Log on if you got the raw bites and ram
I'm louder than a bomb, here to fight the man
Like Public Enemy, here to shed light that tans
Darkness (darkness everyone), darkness hides the scams
While you're in the crowd tryin' ta fight with fans
Fuck around and get beat up wit'cha your mic stand
Expansion team's like the last samurai clan (*sword slicing*)
slashing by air, by sea, and by land (OH)
Sentinels attack and I fight the program
Like David and Goliath, they gave us no chance (nope)
Calculate data, spit romance
and rock mics, Babu's nice with both hands
Battled(?) worldwide and coast-to-coast fam (yep)
Rakaa broadcastin' live from Los Angelos
In my own way I'm a bit of an evangelist
slash California Cannabis Cup champion
Okayplayer bang bang with aim
And put it on the line for real to get fame
In real time you feel the shit change
Your butterknife, I open you up like switchblades
We're still here but others a switch games
We still ride while others a switch lanes
We're swingin' into smacks grown men like Rick James
to kids hidin' behind internet nicknames (woo)

[Chorus 2X] (Defari singing with Rakka ad-libing)
You tight, we tight, it's okay
You nice, we nice, it's okay (Rakaa:player)
You play, we play it's okay
All day, everyday, it's okay X2

[Evidence]
Yo international cat, just got my passport back
Flyin' DC Tens born December tenth,
To those who passed, still remember them (rest in peace)
To those who talked trash, still remember them (eat a dick)
Got lady friends, each one gets my time,
It's always "me and her' instead of "her and I",
So selfish I gotta change my act,
I say "tomorrow" then push the appointment back (oops)
Some say the workin' man's a sucker,
Don't know if I agree but ain't tryin' to be a trucker
Be yourself I suggest
these kids droppin' out of college think they're Kanye West (*laughing*)
This year I'm the hitman but not for hire (nope)
Bush is the prez but I voted for Dave Meyers (yeah)
My crew's established, hate or love us it's only a
Grammy I give a fuck about, or my parent's mothers
Everyday used to steal paint from errand brothers,
tag my way home I live with they film colors (spraying sounds)
Hodgers and Pac-Men, all police captains
stay the fuck outta Dodge, avoid harassment
I'm talkin' to you, that's who I'm lookin' towards
Everytime I hit'cha, put my cap forward
Keep my caps unlocked when I check the board
Okayplayer with Dilated, rest assured.

[Chorus 4X]

Typed by: janis@betatesters.com

1 - 	[Destiny's Child]
 	I was once a fool too
	I know what he's putting you through
	So don't tell me what I should do
	I ain't gonna end up like you

	His love has gotten' you blind
	Wake up and use your mind
	I let you do your thing
	Stop playa hatin' on me

Kelly, ain't it a shame
That boy you call your man
He's runnin' game
Don't mean to cop you out 
But you gettin' played
I'm just looking out
Don't let him do you that way

Repeat 1

Beyonce, oh Beyonce
Don't talk about my man cuz your's was fade
You woke up here was sprung, you oh so in love
But I let you be so let me be alone
(Let me be alone)
No way will I stay and watch him play you for a fool
Don't let a playa play on you

Repeat 1

I'm just looking out
You're my girl, no doubt
I know how men can be
I just think he loves me
Don't be a fool no more
I can't let him go
I'm trying to make you see
I still think he loves me

[William Floyd] - rap
Yeah, yeah, now check it
You don't know how I feel
You need to stop trippin'
You don't even know the deal, for real
Nothing but love and respect for this girl
That's why she's laced with these diamonds and pearls
Now I know she's been hurt in the past
Gon' find a way to make this love affair last
You got too much time on your hands
You need to stop hatin' and find your own man
He can't tend first child love the sand
Baby girl for you I tip all this land
Gainst the forces of Satan, we gotta make a stand
We could be lovers and the best of friends
A legion of swords couldn't make me retreat
That just shows how much your love inspires me
When I look in your eyes and I know there's a smile
Put it all together, you're my Destiny's Child

Freeform fetish medicine for your headaches
We bomb fellas, better send for the medics
Napalm telepath tightrope walker
Stay on mellow as quite dope author
Night stalker, Charlie Mann's my man
Avid attic mic smoker out in Amsterdam
Black Barishnykov with the gift to floss
In fact you pissed me off and you gets the jaw smashed
This here's the rawness that ripped em off
And wack shit gets dissolved as the gift revolves
around earth space agent that'll rock ya pah
Have you runnin for your Gramps for a lil baklava
Let me, talk to y'all bout some off the wall
rapper wannabe in front of me that got the balls
to not know who the G.A.B. be me
The nocturnal, elite MC, they flee from
Ease on down the rhyme train trap design aimed
at your mind, came back to shine, play it back
The time and days of the last breaths of life
leave your spine ablaze when my ass bless the mic, c'mon

One of a kind..
Let me, steadily, wreck the, melody
Check the, Cherokee, techniques, varying
every week, next week, instead of these
head'll be like - let's see, exiting the next brain
Let's speak, hypothetically you are extremely extinct
I phonetically the hip-hop, be the best thing
By the power vested in me, I keep flexing
Now it's G-I-F to the T, come now, test me
Gets things, done when I think and my thoughts distinct
I'm the link in the lock that's missing
Find a pea in the pod that's glistening, shining, it's me
History, in the making awakening this industry
to this beat I'm christening it's sizzling
In this thing, intuitive thoughts just like gypsies
It's risky, when you want a bout with mic's Big Chief
I rip these, and do it out loud while y'all lip sync
You pygmy, you'll never get rid of me, renege this
against me inevitably y'all gon' dig me
Essentially, incredible feat, of raw energy
Immensely, embedded inside y'all intensely

Who da fuck these jealious cops just takin us for
Pull me over, search my car,  they be lookin for war
I put aside da superstar shit, because they'll prolly left me scar'd wit some horrable facts, 
Because i'm black, i'm a tar-get, so reguardless
Gotti be involved, is some hard shit
Screamin fuck da police, niggaz died in these streets
My lil' homie murdered, by these cowards in blue
Dressed him in his best suit and layed'em down in his casket
And for your foes, don't worry
I'll barry those bastards, smother their kids wit plastic, turn they house to ashes
I'd rather die blastin, den face da courts again
Unless i'm facin is death and for my days dats left
I'll be New Orleans motherfuckin threat

[Chorus x4]


[QB]
All niggaz get caught up, shoot, duck
But you can't run nigga, to much stressful shit happened in a dirty city

Album:  No More Prisons
Song:   Outasite
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Apani B. Fly Emcee]
Besides bein guilty, heads been jailed
for many different reasons, rottin away for what seems like
+2000 Seasons+, can't afford bail
Ran out of cash or maybe Legal Aid failed
Like Christ in 33 A.D., they got nailed
Hard to breathe sharin air with, murderers and thieves
You can't leave, situation look pale behind bars of steel
Eatin steal meals, waitin to appeal
Awakened by squeals, soft niggaz get a raw deal
Outside feels worlds away
Future hangs in the balance, stayin alive is a challenge for
underpriveledged negroes and latinos who, populate prions
Displayed in cages for the nigga exhibit
Dancin monkeys makin faces for parole boards
Speak low and tell em how you found the Lord
Keep your fingers crossed
Soldiers sometimes fall on they own sword

Chorus: Apani B. Fly Emcee + L.I.F.E. (repeat 2X)

Outamind and outasite
Seems like it rains all day and all night
Ain't got no rights
Prayin for a ray of sunlight
Got everything to lose
but can't afford to fight

[L.I.F.E.]
Son hold your head while away - ain't things changed
Same shady looks, and money gettin schemes
while the trigger's got us balancin on beams
Alphanumeric life sentences, cause they control what's right
Just last week my man got bagged for a fight
or was it cause he was the defender on the other side
Stabbin to save his life, with a knife
It's already been programmed, billboards, steel surroundings
Keep us grounded, like the worms that we are
My species, is in danger, considered endangered
The plan is to keep us behind bars
like the animals that we are
We runaway slaves like Douglass, lookin towards the North Star
Used to think freedom was up North, but instead those ideas got
torched and scorched, disfigurin my views
that this world was made for us, what substance?
Everytime we spend the green, written In God We Trust
we helpin our oppressors to build more iron steel resorts for us
Many of us get stuck in sticky no-win situations
We and the police, different world, where they tryin to
remove generations, physical evaporation by methods of incarceration
They lockin down this whole nation
while proclimatin martial law
And what bugs me out is we still at war

Chorus

[Apani B. Fly Emcee]
Seen brothers leave never to return
Respect they thought they earned left em tagged bagged and burned
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Hate to eulogize another crew member, but if I must, I must
Can't disguise disgust, gone is faith and trust
in illusions of democracy, it's nearly obsolete
Under government confines, the end of the line
is a long hiatus in, capital, institutions
No, rehabilitation
Bein conditioned, pre-programmed by oppression and religion
What kind of world we livin in when young men
envision prison as an extentsion, of ghetto heaven
Wanna gain respect and go out like a legend?
Gotta learn life lessons the hard way -- oh well
No details that the caged bird tells
Eyes and hearts swell when I think of my nigga Islam in a cell

Shit!, the game is real so you must stay strong
All I see is cats locked up and dead and gone

[A-Dog]
I know cats that hate to take flicks
Blood thick in the hip by lingua chicks
Eager to strip, cornball slip, they knees stash closer to my dick
Savage dude eatin food disturbin the eagle trips
Son kissed to my lips bein bees played the concrete
Snow in the summer to increase your heart-beat
Duke, make it happen so retrovior right?
but when I black out and cut ya'll in half and sayin it ain't right?
Six building of the hook, henny and remy's
Stand dawg lays in samy at your enemy
Now they pass memories, I pal chicken til the death
Legal raw or legal I'm covered so fuck the ATF
Now fact the lord my thoughts are raw
I'm capable to leave the sickness seemed to chair-fold
Now the fair war, or severe any man hoar head
Shots chest, shots squeeze til this red hot
Bubble like where hustle and numb rocks
Soften your hard rocks wit one shot
And put your mind on your opposery
Blood ooze on his rose-rary

3 passports, 3 first class tickets to the money
Straight flights..

I live by the code, wardrobe from round the globe
All I need is a kilo, an apron - show me the stove
General Electric perfected, cooking them Oâ€™s
No more peanut butter sandwiches now we looking at loaves
Hoes, I need a condom for my toast
Busting in these niggas, standing flat footed, Iâ€™m on my toes
Froze, pandemonium overdose
Paparazzi in the trees, please curtains closed
Armadillo cigars, killers who like to play golf
Heroin transactions with Russian shots of the Smirnoff
Playing for keeps, I bust in em fore she get off (HUH)
I run the city just pull up and drop the kid off
Hah, welcome to organized crime
Money got me excited, Iâ€™m coming four or five times
The .45 for you niggas with nine lives
Penthouse on Collins, money long as Ocean drive (ah)
Black Chevy Tahoeâ€™s, Hatians up out the potholes
My place spacious, smoking aces in Lagos
Feds get involved, Iâ€™m slipping off into Senegal
Issue your warrant, informant, bitch Iâ€™ve been a boss
Counting money stacks, yours' counter-fitted
I made my money back when your accountant didnâ€™t
Went against the odds, there's only one Rozay
{M-M-Maybach Music} My nigga okay

[Chorus: Rick Ross]
I got a penny in my pocket (HUH), million in the trunk (HUH)
Started in the back, now we the niggas in the front (WHOO)
Step out on the block all the bitches they still in shock (WHOO)
Get a piece of pussy then take my niggas to shop (HUH)
Pandemonium, causing pandemonium
Half a million for the same car we rolling in (AH)
Pandemonium, pandemonium
We the number one niggas your bitch noticing (HUH)

[Meek Mill]
Rollin', rollin', yeah
Million ways to make this money, you gon' get it
On the grind twenty-four/seven, Iâ€™m with it
YSL swagger, wrist wear frigid
Jumping out the Phantom like a muthafucking midget
Money knocking at the front door Iâ€™m like, who is it
Itâ€™s Benjy, tell my lil nigga go and get it
Cause Iâ€™ve been counting all this dirty paper for a minute
Lamborghini dreaming thinking how Iâ€™m gon' spend it
Iâ€™m like oneâ€™s for the money, twoâ€™s for the show of it
Threeâ€™s for the bitches that be fucking for the ho of it
Four for my niggas that be stacking and then blowing it
You would think I had a curfew the way Iâ€™m going in
Look at what we rolling in, causing pandemonium
Papi got them keys in, he like my custodian
I was tryna bag a brick, you was Nickelodeon
I was in them trenches getting down and dirty serving it
Weâ€™s part the reason that them Churches got some services
The morgue could afford just cause we was doing the murdering
Nigga called my phone talking reckless I ain't heard of it
Fuck your girl, give her back Iâ€™m courteous
I can keep a +Secret+ with +Vicky+ have a menage/Minaj with Nicki
And be out +London+ with +Lauren+ and telling Meagan Good morning
Catch me rolling/Rowland with Kelly or at the +Hilton+ with +Paris+
From Hollywood to the hood, I want a mom and I swear 
that I want em all, wanna fuck em all
Had my niggas down so Iâ€™m screaming fuck the law
Monday night wrestling, Iâ€™m so fucking raw
She gon wipe me down, Iâ€™ma brush her off
Iâ€™m way harder than the concrete, I say what my mind speak
Word to the homie Ross I can get that nine piece
For the low that nine cheap, call me if you want it
Haters see me and I'm stunting, got em sick to their stomach, ha

[Chorus]

[Wale]
Just count me in.. yeah
Whole time, see that fly shit Iâ€™ve been on
All the girlfriends fall in line from my spin off
That's game bitch, ain't shit, Nudies and some J six
Where Iâ€™m from itâ€™s cold and niggas get at you like handkerchiefs
God bless you unless you was disrespectful
Bitches dissappoint you but money wonâ€™t ever stress you
They say Iâ€™m special as Devin Hester on fourth down
So all that shit you niggas kicking we ain't worried about
Catch me at tha carry out, mumbo sauce and half and half
Flyest niggas out here, period no maxi-pad
Bitch I got a right to brag, bitch I got a right to boast
Presidential suite and bitch, I never use my right to vote
My vision enormous, my bitches is gorgeous
And I am dead serious, bitch I spit with embalming
Shout out to lil g, shout out Tre and Mohammad
That BOA shit we get paid with death over dishonor
Iâ€™m known as Obamaâ€™s though I know no-one in Congress
These bitches love me all the way, you got sortaâ€™s and kindaâ€™s
Sort of remind you, why you donâ€™t court no vagina
Just give em awesome intercourse and ignore their inquires
Quietly becoming a top tier
You dreamed of getting green, best believe Iâ€™m John Deere
Greenist Moncler shit, earth tones in the winter
Purp rolled in a rillo, I am on my John Lithgow
Out of this 3rd Rock, nigga air it out
I am on my Tom Brady yâ€™all niggas is Eric Crouch
What the bloodclot, Tommy Frazier fuck yourself
I can't see your album coming, that shit's like a sucker punch
Head for breakfast, fuck for lunch, dinner time she bring a friend
Write my shit so vicious, yâ€™all are like snitches, you canâ€™t see the pen
Always on some new shit -- CNN
Shittin' on these niggas like I need Depends

But in the meantime, listen to the rhyme
By the Comrads, 'frumtha I, and Mack Dime
Bido's on the drum roll, rockin' the beat
Aiyyo Binky, where's you gonna take this shit man?

[Binky Mack]
Aiyyo, let's take it to the streets 
Let them understand perfection
Let knowledge be the tool for suckers to stop guessin'
Cause I don't give a fuck about no Radio play
Observed the gangster shit I display
Lyrics for the adults, children have been barred
Scarred from listenin' to suckers so motherfuckin' hard
Dope, pumpin' that's all our shit will never falter
It's Binky Mack not the Mind of Minolta
Psycho, like no, other motherfucker
So step to me wrong, G-O for what you N-O
But be warned, never will I leave like a regular
Cause I'm a little better than the regular competitor
I used to see them on stage
Earnin' money like a thief, but without a guage
Until I got full, of clockin the lame gettin' pull
(Aiy Binky, they said you ain't gon' get paid)
Nah, that's bullshit!  
They like it stylistic
And I enchant the crowd like I'm a mystic
(C-C-C-C) C-C-C-cameras are flashin, when I'm in action
A photo, or fresh with a flair for fashion
Pure simplicity, see, it's elementary
You hear one of the hardest motherfuckers this century
Tryin' to comply, a word to the wise and the guys
Parental discretion is advised

[Squeak Ru]
Squeak is must be straight high performance
My dick is an enormous, for you bitches that's horrorin'
Shit I don't take it, not even in a toliet
My niggaz don't fake shit, cause we're ballin'
Turn up the pilot as it burns
And maybe, you motherfuckers will learn
I'm not a Dub, yeah, I speak sensible
I smoke hub, the number one principal
I'm engineerin; the shit that you're hearin'
Cause when it comes to power, I'm power steerin'
Silly you say, I say you're silly when you say it
Rush my tape to the deck, and shake your ass when you play it
Like Apollo, but I'm not an amateur
And I'm not givin' a fuck, when I damage you
For the record, here Squeak, he's gonna spin it
And if there was a trophy involved, I'll win it
Possession is mine cause I'm the holder
And a nigga like Squeak don't give a fuck when I fold ya
So you best to step off and be wise
Fuck it, ha ha, parental discretion is advised

[The Comards]
I be well as known as a bandit
You gotta break bread cause you know the nigga's scandalous
And if you fail to see, read it in braile
I'll be still dumpin' chickens
Now, what's next is the flex of the genius
My rapid-stutter-steppin' if you seen this
Dope, you know, I got your whore on my pennies
Bitch made, niggaz fought the high-top faze
It's not my trademark, when I get loose in the dark
I guess, you wasn't stress for the crack pipe
But it's just another motherfucker on the pile
That's drivin' your ass with the flow of the tongue
You hung yourself short
The after-knowledge was brought to you attention
By the hardest motherfuckin' artist that is known for lynchin' 
Any buster in a minute, stagger them all
When I start dumpin' better check your drawers
Gang Spine is a no doubt whip in a battle
Move like a snake when I'm mad; and then my tail rattle
I get low, take your whore and let your kids go
When I bust, parental discretion is a must

[K-Mac]
Little did they know, that I would be arrivin'
I know these busters been wonderin' where the fuck I been
But it's the K here to make more money
It's funny, how we're gettin' paid when our record be played
You're fuckin' regular, yo, as I get bitches the
Bitches wanna lay me and start suckin' up on the dick
So I get them hot, thinkin' that I'ma fuck them
As they sit, bumpin' their legs like a cricket
To you it may be funny
But the bitch can't get no dick, without money
So slip your C-note
And she can suck on this wing-ding-ding-a-ling down her throat
Foreplay; to me ain't shit
Whenever she spread them, then you can get the dick
Of Mr. K-Mac, if she can deal with the size
But if she can't, parental discretion's advised (*echoes*)

"And we'd like to thank our junior ushers for doing
such a wonderful job, look at 'em ... Pastor Skillz's
last sermon with us today.  But it's not a sad time
it's a wonderful and joyous occassion.  Pastor
Skillz's last sermon ... Pastor Skillz."

Before our presentation
I'd like to thank the members of the congregation
For being patient
This morning I got a lil' somethin' to say
How many of y'all woke up and didn't even feel like comin' down here?
Well, Brother James, it's a shame
I know you're sitting there, and all you're worried about is your football game
Well, me and the Lord, we worry about some things
Like you in the parking lot, smoking on your rock cocaine
(Say what?)  Man, everybody know it
And if your mom can't read the announcements faster
I'ma hafta let her go
And Sister Alice, you late
'Cause don't think I don't see you stealin' out my collection plate
Y'all don't hear me ... 'cause if you did, you'd pray I told you
'Cause if you do it in the dark, it's gonna come to the day
And Brother Todd, I know that times is hard
Ask the church for help, you ain't gotta steal money from your job
You can't cheat, 'cause the man up above
ain't no sense stealing if ya' gonna blow it at strip clubs
An' Sister Keisha, don't look in his direction
He wouldn't be at your strip club if his wife gave him some affection
The choir need to sing a song for y'all
This morning I need to know what is wrong with y'all
Satan's swinging his swords again
Sister Kim keyed up the door to my Benz
Now the teacher said I got to reach you
Somebody said "Pastor, teach" so I'm preach
That's what I came to do
And Lord knows, Sister Williams, we all need to pray for you
You can't do this, I knew you was ghetto
If backsliding was a sport, you'd have a gold medal
The dinners you sold last week was cold
And the fish you fried was two weeks old
I know you did it, so go on and admit it
Half the choir ain't here, 'cause they home sick
Y'all my people, but I know ya' well
We in some troubling times, it ain't hard to tell
But some a' y'all are goin' to hell
If you keep leaving Bible study to watch Dave Chappelle
Lord knows I love ya' brothers deep
But don't sit in the pew if you been smokin' weed
I know you're saying "Pastor, "
But Lord, I'ma tell it like it GI is
And Sister Gladys, ya' need to repent
'Cause when I call your house, I hear 50 Cent
This house is in a mess
We got some problems in here that we need to address
And the ushers I shouldn't have to mention
You so busy dancing to Usher to pay attention
And Brother Wayne, you can't take the sound
You bootleggin' services and sellin' 'em downtown
What am I gonna do?
I can lead you to the door, I can't take you through
Now bear with me, it's almost over
I gotta speak on it, y'all, and get the dirt off my shoulder
I'm a city (?), so you gotta get it clear
Deacon Smith's been having affair for twenty-two years
Some a' y'all is doin' wrong
But I'm gonna go on, I told ya' I wasn't gonna hold ya' long
Now I ain't got much more to say
Me and Tony goin' to Shaunie's, we gonna miss the buffet

Typed by: nelly@itis.com

Verse 1:
Yeah um, I pray to the Lord on the floor 
I swore I'd bring on world war 4 (why?)
Cause rappers wanna walk my path 
But they don't know that my path is like a plane crash aftermath
Vocals of danger 
Coject our style when told I won't be caught up in the chamber
I reign from the west coast
Part man the other half pure espestose
Think twice before you try Christ
California terrorist got you caught in my sights
I play triple yatzee with Nazis
Sip Asti Spumanti with Khadafi
Givin' MC's ceasenan sections (with what?)
With this venomous selection
I posess the powers and finesse
To aid alphabets and destruct like bullets
I be the brainstorm the weathman couldn't predict
And when I rain asphalt splits from my brain
Acid hip hop facists
And when I drop my neutrons I turn the masses to ashes
No dust is necessary the progosis is likeness I control like a hypnotist
If I didn't rap I'd work for UPS
Sendin' niggas to hell Priority Express, yeah

Hook:
(WHERE YOU FROM?) Killa Cal
(WHAT'S YOUR NAME?) Vooodu
(DOIN' WHAT?) Keepin' it real keepin' it true
(WHY?) Cause I'm respected as if I was God
HemisFear's my squad enemies get scared      (x2)

Verse 2:
Your blood ain't even worth sheading 
There's no cure when my infection starts spreading
I'm deadlier then Freddy Krueger with a rueger
Crews be like the loser with my murderous manuvers
You must be children of a less God
Cause why am I able to crash your heavens and leave 'em scared
Large like astronomics my phonics must be hooked on homicide
Killing A through Z and anything inbetween
Your cruising for a crucifix
I need a fix my dopeness is heroin times nine
One ill rhyme givels life like enzymes
My pit lines write plaques not paragraphs
Trillions of killabytes I generate megamath
Human begins become an endangered species
When I release these poisionus thesis

Hook (x2)

Verse 3:

Sometimes I kill slow sometimes I kill quick
Wanna test this punk test this stick
How soon can I make theis room a tomb
I howl at full moons and shoot crews at high noon
You'd rather get hit by a car then try and deal with this force field
Men get killed
Psychological warfare, rappers are missing in action
Because of the Los Angeles assassin
I take the bones of the microphones
Remove the hormones to change my DNA rap tunes
My mental capacity causes catastrophies
There's nothing existing that can last with me
Rhymes rip the continent I make it raw
Rappers try to deal they dound them dead on Crenshaw
And Vanas I told 'em you will end up like Ron Goldman
If you disrespect the west (yo) 
And he violated at the worst degree
That's why we gave him a fatal injury 
Your arms lift from a death sentence      (pouring sound)
I break you down till it quit

Outro:
Shout to the Western HemisFear armed forces: Meen Green, Ras Kass, Byrd,
Vooodu, 95 baby. Profound elements. Verbal corporation. Western HemisFear
will surface. Killa Cal. yeah yeah.

Song:   Puttin' Check Down
Typed by: hknight@geocities.com

No, oh God no, what have you done?
For every action there's an equal or greater reaction
Shit happens for the hearing impaired in closed-yacking
If I can't get no motherfucking satisfaction
We don't snatch kids, here we go nicknapping
Tell ya in plain English, not in Pig Latin
My enemies just straight lucky I been rappin
But even when I get rich I'm still gon' trap men
Addicted to the thrill of the hunt and big action
I don't bungee jump or skydive to get a rush
Tying punks up, lumpin' em up is fun enough
These are ghetto extreme sports to us
Stayin' combo and buy 5-0 with guns tucked
Daily, testin' my nuts fuckin' with Lady Luck
Beat a nigga to the punch and I stomp him in the slush
Sip beer and smoke blunts, put humps in dump trucks
Went to school with the garbageman and keeps it on the hush
For a few thousand bucks, we ghetto fabulous

Chorus (4x):
Puttin' check down
Step down, or let's get down
And then we burn down the next town

I'm a loose cannon
That mean I bust without planning
Harry Zorannon, keeps all business handlin'
It's a lot of money in the streets I got my hands in
Take food out my kid mouth, nigga, you gambling
With your life against niggas used to scrambling
Doin' dirt, puttin' in work, distributin' hurt
In wars over turf, slip here, we cling & jerk
When I ??murk??, tires chirp, I'm the black Wyatt Earp
Lookin' for a reason to let my new heater burst
You ain't the first or the last nigga that I made the ??past vision??
Down, for the get-down nigga, how you figga?
Not too many fools livin' nice so on the trigga
Duckin' me is like not touchin' snow in a blizzard
Or a black man blushing, can't happen, no discussion
So stop frontin' before I plan your abduction
????????This gas all up in it got drama too deep to debted????????
Fuck credit, you owe me your life and I come to get it

Chorus (4x):
Puttin' check down
Step down, or let's get down
And then we burn down the next town

I believe I can fly, never die, I ain't gun shy
One god to you bitchass niggas hung high
Become my victims from tryin' to steal my sunshine
Talk shit but when they see me in the flesh, tongue-tied
Hypnotized, why actin' all lady-like?
Paralyzed by the nightmares I brung to life
Put out there like a deer in the metro's headlights
My eyes are two scopes with the infrared sights
It's natural to ride, we kill to stay alive
It's self defense, so I don't call it homocide
I'm like a wild animal with the will to survive
And yo, even at church I got a gun or a knife
Prepare for the holy war, second coming of Christ
Step to one of my boys, we all jump in the fight
Young, dumb, and full of cum, still stuck in the life

Chorus (4x):
Puttin' check down
Step down, or let's get down
And then we burn down the next town
Artist: Lyrics Born
Album:  Quannum Spectrum
Song:   Hott People
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

For all the late night peoples out there

"Rock rock y'all.." (2X)
"Rock y'all.." (2X) 
	".. and let's do it!"

[Lyrics Born]
You know there comes a time in everybody's life when
we just need a little bit of guidance
You know we get a little lost in the fog
and it sort of impedes our vision
But there's a way that we can figure it all out
and make it happen, make it work

The purpose of producin beautiful soul music is two-fold
One is fun - two goes to mute all the roof hogs
Let's build, useful tools, find some resolution in our lives
Three's to get your groove on, but it ain't like there's no
particular order, this ain't a true/false, answer only part of it
Everything's got an art to it
So we bottle it, market it, it don't hold water
well then we sharpen it, carve a little niche where we can all exist
as ourselves, not our sales
Despite our ails (OOH DO TELL!)
Cause I can't part with the alcohol, no doubt bruh
And on that note, I'm like my Southpaw Grandpah
He used to get his lamp on, he used to giggle at Tampons
And I'm probably not supposed to talk about that part
who cares though that's not important
I really broke all the sample laws with this damn song
so now I'm an outlaw
But it's time, we started talkin havin dialogue and bein honest
What's the other options - walk around, bottled up all hot and bothered
Makin assumptions and nothin gets accomplished
Can we set it off properly please?

Chorus: Lyrics Born (repeat 2X)

To the people, the people
To the people, the people
To the people people people
To the people (You're HOTT)

[Lyrics Born]
Yeah.. feelin good.. ("rock rock" .. "rock rock y'all")

The purpose of producin beautiful soul music is two-fold
One is fun - two goes to glue all the loopholes
Music is fuel, to get us where we goin in our lives
Three is still to groove on, but it ain't like there's a
paricular void, that's true though, that's my whole argument
That's where I'm at, there's where I've always been
Cause we've made accomplishments, we just need to proceed
with the utmost confidence - so, whether that encompasses you
signing up with your community nautilus
Buy a couple joggin suits, hop up on that pommel horse
and burn some ounces off your gluts, your upper abdominals
Openin offices, in major metropolises
Get some flossy cards, your logo embossed on em
Not the cost effective models
where you gotta cross the old pager number off the bottom
and draw, all kinds of lines all across it
and write your mom's spot, on top, and along the side of em
like, "Aww man, my pencil's not sharp -- know what?
Let me, let me just get your card, tight
Also, is it possible, can you run me by a Jack in the Box?"
Like I should, open office, minimize losses
Reinvest profits, we refine the process
by readin all the options, keepin all we promised
So we not caught up, all the fellas with the pants down
ladies caught topless, showin they casabas
Ignore that garbage, that was just some old nonsense
Strictly off the top shit, measurin the progress
The heart has the yardstick, anything else?  Uhh yes..

"rock rock y'all.. a rock rock y'all.. and let's do it!"

Chorus 2X w/ variations

[Lyrics Born]
Yeah
This is the message that I'm tryin to get out to all the people
(What's that?)  Just that we gotta stay positive, y'know?
Keep it (HOTT) Yeah (KEEP IT HOTT)
That's right, keep it sizzlin (REAL HOTT)
What? (REALLY HOTT)
Hehe.. SSSSSSSSSS (SSSSSSSSSSS)
(KNOW WHAT I MEAN?)

"ah rock rock y'all" (2X)
"rock y'all", "ah rock rock y'all"
"rock y'all", "and let's do it!"

[Intro: The Rock (Slick Rick)]
Hmm, mmm-mmm-mmm
You know The Rock's gonna tell you a little story
You ain't gonna believe it, but he's gonna tell you anyway
It's tough to be The Rock!
Ah-na-na, shut your mouth, no no
It really is! Even though The Rock is-
The Rock is the most electrifying man in all of showbiz
You see when The Rock gets too much, too much of the fame
And all the bright lights
He likes to kick back and have a slice of that unadulterated delight
(Welcome to Rick's bakery can I help -- wait a minute,
aren't you the famous Rock?)
Yeah, The Rock, the People's Champ in the house
What's happenin Slick? (Oh my God, hey, how you doing?
Guy, listen, you gotta take a picture with me before you leave, guy)
Whoa, whoa, whoa, The Rock don't wanna take pictures
The Rock just wants a piece of pie
You gotta any of that in this bakery?
(Oh, I got every kinda pie you can think of
I got strawberry pie, blueberry pie) Blueberry what?
(Apple pie...) Ah nah no no, whoa whoa whoa
Actually Slick, it doesn't matter what type of pie you have
Let The Rock tell you a little story, about pie...

[The Rock] (Slick Rick)
Drivin down south, though quickly aroused
When my car caught a flat, and then this old farm house
I hope somebody's home, takin a chance at it
Knocked on the door, and this fine chick answered
(You're The Rock!) Can I use your phone? 
(I'm shakin, sure, if you try some of this pie I'm makin)
Daisy dukes shorts on, five foot stood
Said sure, what the heck, I mean it did smell good
(So when she caught Rock in the kitchen, towards to rate her)
There's her grandmother, aunt and a Chinese neighbor?

[Interlude: The Rock]
Well The Rock is gonna tell you again
You see it's tough to be The Rock!
Yeah, The Rock knows, that might sound crass
Oh, and by the way
All you jabroni's in the locker room
You can all come kiss The Rock's ass!
Cuz you know after The Rock lays a smackdown
On some big fat ugly hermaphrodite!
The Rock needs a little distraction
And a slice sounds just right...

[Slick Rick] (The Rock)
The Rock's, thanks ladies, and more kind words
Grandmother said (Be polite, eat mine first
So I sat down, tried her, she looked quite glad
Had a strange tastin mold, but it wasn't so bad)
That's right (The Rock, havin pie in the country
Devoured, here's her aunt, and Stella was hungry)
That's all Rock said? (Bored, readin the paper
Til finally a plate of the next door neighbors
Dogged it down fast, cuz it really did please)
I mean it tasted so good, Rock was talkin Chinese!
(Ching-bang-wing-gon-aiiiii!! That good pie!)
Oh, that's the pie you was talkin about

[Outro: The Rock]
Oh yeah, The Rock knows the millions can smell it now
It's tough to be The Rock!
No, no, no, no, it really is
Because you all know, The Rock is the most!
Electrifying man in all of showbiz!
You see when The Rock gets too much, too much of the fame
And all the bright lights, he loves to kick back and have a slice
No, no, no, no, no, The Rock is gonna eat the whole damn pie!

[Helicopter Propellers]

[Man's Voice]
Well the first thing I want to say is:

They say real recognize real
The dollar bill will exercise our ills...E
Frauds is thoroughly camouflaged and fatigued in the field
Be careful who you believe, the pills
Is dealed like flaccid, proceeds go towards the buying of Caprice Classics
With the wheels to match it, so they can mack it
Like an automatic weapon stepping off into traffic
Like, check him, tears roll down the eyes
Of the rides inside of a funeral procession
Here lies, with X's in his eyes, the unguided misdirected
Squad cars roll past and laugh

[Chorus (Sample)]
Out There
Out There
There
There
There

They say the streets is a demon in a dress
Wit dollar signs in her eyes and semen on her breath (UH!)
Scantly clad, no panties, deep throating in an alley
Aging badly in sunglasses she pretty
Slain boyfriend names is tattooed on her titties
Sprinkling greed, ignorance, and envy inside of a Philly
Hennessey tears, ass will bring ya enemy's here
Flirt wit her flaws till you run up in her raw

[Chorus (Sample)]
Out There
Out There
There
There
There

They say the game has the belly of a beast
Blunts for fingers and hollow tips for teeth
Wire taps for ears, Nike Airs for feet
Blasphemy for prayers, a system for a heart
Rap music for beats, heroin for a son and it's married to the streets
Crack pipes for lungs, and he never sleeps
Just spies, wit dice in his eyes
Loves life cuz he likes when it dies
Wit a baking soda soul, he cough up pleasure
Clothes made out of dollar bills that he sewed together
He knows, he's clever, jealous his house
All the liquor that's poured out, goes right in his mouth
Rides around on a stray bullet;
Wit prostitutes, pimps, dope dealers and killers tied to it to pull it
A TV in his head, stripper slides down his legs
And he's known to ride around wit feds, and he's out there

[Chorus (Sample)]
Out There
Out There
There
There
There

But, righteousness is a father teaching his kids
That what's better than wealth is the respect in itself (Out There)
A pistol packing old lady standing up to the dope dealers
On the block making sure her presence is felt (Out There)
A teacher teaching that thinking is cool
Listen before you mention "not letting school turn them into fools" (Out There)
Keeping god first, Lupe is here
F-N-F Up, homie I'll see u out there (Out There)

[Ese Daz]
Like a rock
I'm rollin'
Cruisin' through the barrio
Hittin' on the switches
Smoking a cigaro
Wet daddy, Superman
Yeah, you know
Call me the Southside Slayer, Harbor Area superhero
Here I come swervin'
With E-Dubb sittin' shotgun
Sippin' on tequila
Rollin' up a phat one
Ganja
That sticky-icky green, can you feel it?
Makes you fly, to the sky, elevate your spirit
Welcome to the world of the Land Of The Lost
No sleek stacks, no chocolate, just G's, drugs and glocks {*gunshot*}
Monte Carlos and Regals that hop
I'm about to hit the switch and start bouncin' up the block

[Chorus: Fingazz]
This is how we roll, we keep it
Groovin' til the break of dawn (So play on)
Just play on
This, is, how, we, roll
So play on (Play on)
Why don't you let, us, play on?

[Ese Daz]
Rolled up, new Coup, brand new, all blue
Chrome shoes, hey dudes, and I make fools bow
Poppin' my collar, you better holler right now
Pimp for life
I want my dollars right now
Smokin' that chaffey, I rolls with my heat
Bitches see me rollin', tryin' to flag and stop me
So they can tell the homegirls that they roll with papi
A Mexican with braids, so that's why they jock me
I changed up the game, now they're trying to copy
Hatin' so much, that they're trying to pop me
They do it too sloppy and they can't stop me
From stompin' 'em like a bitch in the hotel lobby (Putos!)
That's how we roll
In my area, fool
We bury ya, fool
Just for tryin' to caring, you fool
I'm tellin' you fools
Don't try to fuck with us (Heh, ha)
Don't try to fuck with us

[Chorus]

[Ese Daz]
Somos pocos, pero crazy
Insane
Stacee Adams, khakis pants
Tatted up with nicknames
Real eses, real fucked up in the brain
That tequila got my motherfuckin' chest all burned
And gangsters make the world go 'round, it's our turn
Vatos packin' .44's that burn
Stupid motherfuckers ain't gon' never learn
That if you
Fuck with one, then you
Fuck with all
We gon'
Get the guns, then you
Fuckin' fall
Southside for million, one shot
We're killing 'em
You're not from the south, then fool
We're not feelin' ya
Don't need, trees to carve, just need
G's to floss
Them flees out
Flick 'em right
Off of my balls
Niggas
White boys
Eses and all
I'm tryin' to get this feria, now what
About y'all
I'm tryin' to get this feria, now what
About y'all

[Chorus]

[Ese Daz]
Yeah
That's how we roll
For the year 2-Double 0-uno
Ese Daz, Lil' Blue
In the motherfuckin' house
With the homeboy E-Dubb
We rock this motherfucker
Ha ha
H-A in ya motherfuckin' ear drum
310, baby
Ha ha

And we going down in history 
as the baddest playas you ever did see 
As you chillin yo highs and you Banging your lows 
The feet starts moving down to your toes
You start snappin' your fingers and moving your feet 
Your body starts rocking to the shoreshine beat 
I said jam you start movin' your feet 
I said jam Right out of your seat 
Now just throw your hands high in the air 
and wave them all around like you dont care 
Keep rocking to the beat withought no care 
And make sure you come sharp baby for the affair 
Now I'm not as tall as the rest of the gang 
But I bang to the beat just the same 
I got a playas face, and a pair brown eyes

Singing on and on-on and on-on

Well come alive y'all  a gimme what you 
Got cause I'm guranteed to make you roc.

[Mellow Man Ace]
Well I was coming home late one dark afternoon 
reporter stopped me for an interview 
She said she's heard stories she heard fables 
that I'm all drugged out still and turn tables 
This fly reporter I did adore
I got smooth on that ass and popped the car door 
She said damn Mellow Man I'm in love with you
all the stories I've heard they couldn't of been true 
By the way sugar whats your name
She said I go by the name ExoticElaine 
And you can be my boo kid you surely 
can just let me dump my boyfriend the local bud man 
I said he's a Busta I do suppose 
puttin that meth all in your nose 
He may be very paid or even cute
but his raps dead Wack you should give him the boot 
I said you need Mellow Man I got finesse
I got my name in old english tatted on my chest 
He may be able to slang all through the night
but he can't rock a party throught the early light 
He may satisfy you with his little worm, 
but I'm gonna turn that ass out when I get my turn 
Im goin'do it, I'm goin' do it, I'm goin' do it do it do it 
Cause I'm here and I'm there 
cause I'm Mellow Man Ace and I'm everywhere 
So just shock y'all a ticky-tak y'all 
you dont stooopp, you keep on.

[Chorus: Chester French]
You think you're using me, like this game's new to me 
But you ain't confusing me, you just want jewelry and all them fuckin shopping sprees
But that ain't stopping me and I ain't stopping you
See we'll be cool as long as you just play your part
Just your part, just your part
We'll be cool as long as you just play your part

[Rick Ross]
I'm inclined with women who come on they time
She came over and she came a few times
From crispy futons to Christian Louboutin
Game over: had her shopping in Milan
20 racks really thats sneaker money
Triple white Ferrari yeah thats the Easter bunny
At the Ceaser in Vegas yeah I put the Visa on it
Now all she do is tell me how she used to love me
I let her decorate the real estate
And I let her spend half the ticket, give or take
A couple dollars Harry Winston stone collars
Canary yellow everything, plane chartered
I spolied her maybe cause I adored her
More than fly girl, a flying saucer
My Mona Lisa painting on the wall came to life
She said to love a bitch is to roll the dice

[Chorus]

[Wale]
I try to love 'em in the physical, not literal
She said she love me but what I'm feeling is minuscule
I understand that Prada lives in her inner sole
So the devil that drove in her got in control
Anne Hathaway, and sack chasin' getting got cake up
Though my paper way thicker than model make up
But y'all wait up my mind racing my toe slippin
A lot of women is real, some bitches Robin Given
I never give â€˜em no liquid no pot to piss in
I tend to leave them quite offended if they too dependent
I'm pitchin bitches thats dreamin' thinking I'm trickin' chicken
I'm simply fUckin' with bitches that know they whole position
Thats real nigga shit, real nigga life
I give my heart to one broad, the others get the pipe
I ain't tryna fight, I ain't tryna fuss
I'm tryna follow money, they tryna fall in love
Wale

[Chorus]

[Meek Mill]
Yo, I say, how can they compare to you, everything material
Trickin' shit for kids and you know I dont need no cereal
You know I was ridin' and you switched up a gear or two
So all that other shit you on dead -- burial
Funeral, check my phone, reacting like its new to you
Talking what I give but never speak on what I do for you
Cabo to Jamaica every weekend honeymooning you
Lobster over salmon, I ain't never try to tuna you
But now I'm just assuming you living off of hearsay
Treble like the radio cause everything was air play
1st class Hermes, Panamera, purp pass
Greed written on her face when I bought her first bag
And I ain't really give a fuck, it was like a nigga rushed
Told my jeweler make her freeze like I was tryna stick her up
She call me daddy like a nigga puff
Just play your role and you can live it up

Song:   Fuck Tha Police
Typed by: nemesi_@libero.it

Fuck the police, fuck the police, fuck 'em!!!
(surprise)
Fuck the police, fuck the police, fuck 'em!!!
(surprise)
Fuck the police, fuck the police, fuck 'em!!!
(surprise)
Fuck the police!!!
(You muthafuckin' right)

[Krayzie Bone]
Fuck the police comin' straight from the underground
A young nigga got it bad cause I'm brown
And not the other color so police think
They have the authority to kill a minority
But muthafucka makin' as I ain't the one
For a punk muthafucka with a badge and a gun
To be beaten on, and thrown in jail
But we can go toe to toe in the middle of a cell
Fuckin' with a nigga cause a nigga turned major
And got a little bit of money and a pager
Searchin my car, lookin' for the product
Thinkin' every thug nigga is sellin' narcotics
You'd rather see, me in the pen
Than me blowin' endo, rollin' in my Benz-o
I send the police to the grave
And when I'm finished
They will bring the yellow tape
To tape off the scene of the slaughter
Still gettin' swoll off bread and water
I don't know if their're fags or what
Search a nigga down, and grabbin' his nuts
And on the other hand, without a gun they can't get none
But don't let it be a black and a white one
Cause they'll slam you down to the street top
Black police showin' out for the white cop
But Krayzie Bone will swarm
On any muthafucka in a blue uniform
Just cause I'm from, the C-L-E
Them punk muthafuckas be afraid of me
Uh, a young nigga on the warpath
And when I'm finished, it's gonna be a bloodbath
Of cops, dyin' around my way
Yo bitch I got somethin to say

Fuck the police, fuck the police, fuck 'em!!!
(surprise)
Fuck the police, fuck the police, fuck 'em!!!
(surprise)
Fuck the police, fuck the police, fuck 'em!!!
(surprise)
Fuck the police!!!
(You muthafuckin' right)...

[Bizzy Bone]
Fuck the police and Bone said it with authority
Because the niggas on the street is a majority
A gang, and is with whenever I'm steppin'
Then the muthafuckin' weapon is kept in
a stash spot, for the so-called law
Wishin' Bone was a nigga that they never saw
Lights start flashin' behind me
But they're scared of a nigga so they mace me to blind me
But that shit don't work, I just laugh
And plus it gives 'em a hint, not to step in my path
The police, I'm sayin': "Fuck you punk!"
Readin' my rights and shit - it's all junk
Pullin' out a silly club, so you stand
With a fake-ass badge and a gun in your hand
But take off the gun so we can see what's up
and we'll go at it punk and I'ma fuck you up
Make you think I'ma kick your ass
But drop your gat, and Bone's gon' blast
I'm sneaky as fuck when it comes to crime
And I'ma smoke 'em now and not next time
Smoke any muthafucka that sweats me
And any asshole, that threatens me
I'm a sniper with a helluva scope
Takin' out a cop or two, they can't cope with me
The muthafuckin' killer that's mad
With potential, to get bad as fuck
So I'ma turn it around
Dig in the clip, yo, and this is the sound
BOOM BOOM - yeah, somethin like that
But it all depends on the size of the strap
Takin' out a police, will make my day
And a nigga like Bone don't give a fuck to say

Fuck the police, fuck the police, fuck 'em!!!
(surprise)
Fuck the police, fuck the police, fuck 'em!!!
(surprise)
Fuck the police, fuck the police, fuck 'em!!!
(surprise)
Fuck the police!!!
(You muthafuckin' right)...

[Layzie Bone]
I'm tired of this muthafuckin' jackin'
Sweatin' my thug while I be thuggin' in the shack and
Shinin' them lights in my face and for what?
Maybe it's because I kick so much, but
I kick ass nigga or maybe cause I blast
On a stupid-ass nigga when I'm playin' with the trigger
Of any Uzi or an A.K.
Cause the police always got somethin' stupid to say
They put out my picture with silence
Cause my identity along with my group cause it's violence
It's the Bone with the criminal behavior
Yeah, I'm a thugster nigga
But still I got flavor
Without a gun and a badge, what do you got?
A nigga in a uniform waitin' to get shot by me
Or one of my niggas
And with a gat it don't matter if you're smaller or bigger
(Size don't mean shit, I'm from the old school fool)
And as you all know Layzie Bone came to rule
Whenever I'm rollin' keep 'em lookin' in your mirror
And ears on cue, yo, so I can hear a
Dumb muthafucka with a gun
And when I'm rollin' off the 8, you'll be the one
That I take out, and then I get away
And while I'm drivin' off laughin' this is what I'll say
Believe that
 
Fuck the police, fuck the police, fuck 'em!!!
(surprise)
Fuck the police, fuck the police, fuck 'em!!!
(surprise)
Fuck the police, fuck the police, fuck 'em!!!
(surprise)
Fuck the police!!!

[Intro: Rick Ross]
{M-M-Maybach Music} HUH!
Rich niggas makin' poor decisions {*3X*}
Damn... shit
Rich niggas makin' poor decisions
All my little homies up in prison
I'mma let you know just how I'm livin'

[Rick Ross]
I can tell you' bout the Mach Five
I can show you what them blocks buy
I can tell you 'bout my block ties
I can take you to the far side
Poor decision makin' plagued you niggas' lives
You sellin' crack up on your momma porch
While she still goin' through her new divorce
He has a thrill as he raise his voice
When he really needs to raise his boys
Young thugs with so much talent
Young thugs havin' no balance
Young niggas havin' no fathers
Young niggas catchin' dope charges
Growin' up she say she felt alone
Now she strippin' for that pot of gold
Another fish in the bowl
They say her mother never played her role
I heard her mother always on the roll
Her mother always wearin' gold
Where I'm from I guess that's how it goes

[Chorus 1: Rick Ross]
Rich niggas makin' poor decisions {*3X*}
Damn....
Rich niggas makin' poor decisions {*2X*}
All my little homies up in prison
Lupe gotta tell 'em how you livin'

[Lupe Fiasco]
The beloved T-Rex says... (yeah)
Grown man bars is somethin' you gotta deal with (huh)
Whole hand cards but nothin' that you can build with
That sound like bullshit from out a bull mouth (yeah)
Even the tepee is a full house
Simple shelter keep you out the cold
If you hold it close together, we'll never fold
Why you lettin' the devil beat you out your soul
You don't believe in God then at least believe in odds
This house of odds is just a house of cards
Just without the yards, and nice adjacent parks
We was born black but that shit'll make you dark
Even with a handful of hearts
Mind on the club just to find a little love, my regards
Cause when your P-O-V is poverty
It's like D-O-C a lottery, that D-O-C be lock and key
Finna D-O-P-E bob and weave and the boxer boxin' free
Up out them rings like it was Rocky 3 - caught up in the game now
Look at how we came out like OLLY-OLLY-OXEN-FREE!
{*sings*} That ain't why they watchin' me
Yeah, yeah; {*raps*} decided since like 4, 5 or 
sugar coated, colored edibles
Instead of buildin' up a habit in them vegetables
Now early 30s, my blood pressure's incredible
Medical, yeah nigga I'm tellin' you
Covered in cars over community
Rappers influence your shootin' sprees
Turn around and publish bars like it ain't got shit to do with me
Easy to record so ruthlessly... rich niggas

[Chorus 2: Rick Ross]
Rich niggas makin' poor decisions {*3X*}

[Wale]
Yeah, uh, can't tell you 'bout that H dude
But I'll tell you 'bout this hate dude
And I'll show you where they raise a tool
Have a nigga late for the labels or the latest shoes
I'm from an era where gold trinkets could buy attention
And the hoes thinking might blow your winky for a known emblem
Label whores thatâ€™ll fuck a sale and suck a store
Lust apparel, who dream of Rolls, but can't Accord
Or afford, a Dodge, or a Ford
Where she end up on your knob cause she has never been adored
Lord help us, my generation come to an end
Cause we all selfish, but livin' shallow, how we gon' swim?
I mean really why should I pretend?
Walk a day up in my tennis; my soul is possessed
I'm reppin' my set, no matter who posin' against
Once I got hot, they only good option to vent
Ralph! Genius

[Chorus 2]

[Outro: Lupe Fiasco]
Aye Ricky I'mma flip the mission
How 'bout poor niggas makin' rich decisions?
Poor niggas makin' rich decisions
That shit right there is more efficient
I think that might be a better description
Poor niggas makin' rich decisions
Can't afford 'em but you still gon' get 'em
That's a poor nigga making rich decisions
Buyin' jewelry but you know you're vision
Yeah! (On a mission, huh)
Maybe part 2 - YEAH! {M-M-M-M-M-M-Maybach Music}

Just to get home for the night
(I'll do anything for the power)
Lie, cheat, steal, fight
Just to get home for the night
(I'll do anything for the power)

I want everybody at attention
You can call me Mr. Lyon
When I visit, when I visit
(I'll do anything for the power)
If money is the root to all evil
You can see me ball
People never see me fall
Cause I got the power

[Intro]
What is this? {Maybach Music}
I like this Maybach Music! {*laughter*}

[Rick Ross]
If Michael Jackson came alive right now
He'd ask you to smoke one for him
So in his honor
{*flicks lighter, inhales*}
You niggaz Spud Webb, comin up short
Think you're Dee Brown, jump if you want
I put it on my momma and her very last nerve
Ricky made off everything I deserved
The square root of a kilo is me nigga... ugh
The square root of a kilo is me nigga
Do the math, I'm a motherfuckin G nigga
{M-M-M-M-M-M-Maybach Music} {*3X*}

[Gunplay]
It's all on me now, as you can see now
I'm gon' get this money and I will not be denied
Been shittin on you fucks a long time, time to pee now
When you finish first they hate you worse, startin to see now
I'm at the round table, where yo' seat at?
Where yo' plate? where yo' lobster? where yo' sea bass?
We ain't never left, actin like we back
You should see us now takin pictures, actin like we rap
This the circle that'll merk you, black out, short circuit
Somebody show them square ass niggaz the first exit
This here reserved for soldiers most definitely
So watch what you say and where you step mo' carefully
If I fall in the field, and ain't no more air for me
Po' some on the ground and put one in the air for me
Tell my enemies "fuck 'em" they know already but fuck 'em
Tell 'em again with a middle finger and a chuckle {*HA HA HA*}
You don't know na'an nigga, nope, uh uh
This famous that'll still throw copper
Cross so heavy crack the tabernacle, fire the ganja back up
Throw some blow in my tobacco, then crank the 'llac up
One match left, this the last turn
Santeria candles in my sanctuary burn
I'ma earn 'til the last court adjourned
'Til the last gavel drop, we gon' have it locked
{M-M-M-M-M-M-Maybach Music}
We gon' have it locked (have it locked)
{M-M-M-M-M-M-Maybach Music}
We gon' have it locked

[Stalley]
I'm part of the small percentage of niggaz who make it out the ghetto
But niggaz tried to pull me back cause misery loves company
It's funny how they come for me when they see me livin comfortably
But when I was broke and sleepin on floors they ain't want nuttin from me
My future's so bright, but my past so ugly
And I just try to correct it all, but it all still haunts me
Tried to section off the past but it still haunts me
So I accept what got me here, reflectin in this rockin chair
All this space created all that hard work it got me here
So what I look like? Tellin a nigga that I shouldn't be here
Power to the people so the people shouldn't live in fear
And I'll be that raisin voice that tell the people, treat us fair
Warring in the streets tell them soldiers to meet us there
Out in the open all alone I felt the coldest air
Secluded in my thoughts of fear, no one to talk to, no one there
Not even a voice, not even an ear; no one alive, no one to care
Now I got a Power Circle and now I'm on a power trip
And they callin me counterfeit cause I ain't gave a coward shit?
Stone me, throw me a pile of shit, but you won't pull me out of it
It's funny how it comes full circle, now they wanna be a part of the Power Circle
{M-M-M-M-M-M-Maybach Music}
They wanna be a part of the Power Circle
{M-M-M-M-M-M-Maybach Music}

[Chorus 2X: Wale]
May the wind be at your back
May the bad be in yo' past
May the kids take all your good
and your wife have class
And you realize your goals
and what's life, without grind?
Those niggaz, yo' niggaz?
Hope them niggaz, real as mine

[Wale]
There's a difference between underrated and hasn't made it
Once you successful they relentlessly givin you hatred
There's no applause for ya, and success is hard for ya
There's enemies envy but green my niggaz lawnmower
And I'm on tour, Jordan 4's, Tom Ford
And I ain't thuggin, they clappin at me, a encore
Got a dark heart, bright mind, make women crazy
I give her D, I throw up two, I call that shit a safety
Shit is crazy when entertainment ain't entertainin
And my inner sanctum need real estate I'm out my cabeza
Jealousy's for the weak, ye ain't happy I made it?
I be feeling like brother Malcolm, just added a Nation
Allah got us cause if we holla they'll all snub us
I seen hustlers turn cluckers out niggaz grandmothers
So shut the fuck up and listen fuck all them stuck up musicians
My circle's small but regardless my circumference official
My clothes different like quarterbacks at a closed scrimmage
They gon' blitz us but ain't no way that they gon' hit us
I'm so allusive, saw my niggaz be goin through it
I guess it's a wrap when your co-defendant makes soul music
Cash rule the world, at least it do with girls
At least it do with churches, see the truth and true it hurts
If they real, then they real, my niggaz deserve it
And we don't deal with weak squares in this Power Circle
{M-M-M-M-M-M-Maybach Music}
We don't deal with weak squares in this Power Circle

[Meek Mill]
Yeah, Meek Milly, this Maybach <strong></strong>
Uhh~! I'm like welcome to the Power Circle
I came a long way, I started with a powdered circle
Clique full of real niggaz that'll probably merk you
Cause they about that murder game you do a lot of verbal
Lotta talking, lotta tweetin, 'til you hear that chopper speakin
Kill my dog I kill your dog, we tied even I believe it
If you see it then you got it, nigga never give up
Cause if you grindin you gon' be rich before you can look up
My cousin Knock told me never teach niggaz to cook up
Cause you can sell 'em hard for the low and give 'em the hook-up
And still make the profit, the streets say I'm the hottest
and a nigga still modest, I'm just bein honest
Back to the wall, never let 'em get behind us
Mack in my draws fittin right in my designers
Look at my persona, I dreamed it woke up and conquered
And there was commas after commas, I eat 'em like Benihanas
Put the shrimp over the pasta, the pasta over the lobster
And the lobster over the table, Power Circle a mafia
Just talkin money, talkin money what you talkin bout?
Probably talkin bout us, we the only thing to talk about
{M-M-M-M-M-M-Maybach Music}
We the only thing to talk about
{M-M-M-M-M-M-Maybach Music}
Cause we the only thing to talk about

[Kendrick Lamar]
Look inside the highs of the last Mohicans survived
You won't last a weekend outside
Seen a pastor tweakin, then sunk his teeth in a rock his demise
Later on that evening you heard the grieving of angels that cried
See a demon don't compromise
And so I walk alone with a cross and a diamond stone
I'm a diamond inside the rough that's too mighty for maricons
I might as well put all my killers in Y.S.L.
Put my voice on this microphone, put you pussy niggaz through hell
Hell's fire, I never lie, you'll never grind
I know the priors they runnin by us when we do crime
I know that section eight wanna discontinue my moms
When they heard that Ohio state gave me 30 racks in July
Oh Lord, this can't be life, no it can't be life
When the day breaks and you earned them stripes and you learned that strike
From upstate will adjourn that life and confirm that life
It's good bait for the warden that might get awarded and write
down your fate you record it that night, a reporter replied
The death rate will eventually climb, so eventually I'm
on a track race for the dough before time get a clock that resigns
So about face if it ain't business, I get offended, I mind
No one fake, I'm a realest in strive, of a bilion in five
Well a billion cause the limit is the sky, and I live on cloud nine
And I recognize my nemesis gon' try but I'm finishin my shine
But pussy where it hurt you, life in the Power Circle

[Outro: Rick Ross]
Regardless of how it goes down {M-M-M-M-M-M-Maybach Music}
Life goes on, am I right?
Tried to warn you niggaz
I tried to warn you niggaz
It's too late now {M-M-M-M-M-M-Maybach Music}
Double M-G
Too much cake
Too much power
Too much respect
Bow down, nigga {M-M-M-M-M-M-Maybach Music}

[Eminem] O. Trice, c'mon!

[Obie Trice]
Yeah, niggaz got me
I'ma get 'em, it ain't over

[Chorus: Obie Trice]
You can catch me in the whip with a fifth of pimp juice (yeah!)
And I'm poppin the clip, 'bout to fix this issue (woo!)
You pray that I don't hit, I ain't equipped to miss you (no!)
You're gonna need an ambulance to stitch your tissue (nigga!)
Or either have a bag on your hip to shit through (ha!)
You seen us on the ave, ain't just to get you
But my penis is a mag, when I lift it hits you (DA-DA-DA-DA-DA!)
Cause I don't go nowhere without my pistol pistol

[Obie Trice]
I, solemnly swear on my, daughter's tears
The nigga that got him in the head will feel it before the year ends
(That's right) Hope you inconspicuous, my friend
Cause once the word get back you in a world of sin (sin)
Bullets will hurdle at him, for tryin to murder what's
been determined as the first solo African (me!)
To go platinum where the accident happened at
But maggots I'm alive with vengeance to get back (get back!)
My momma blood pressure was affected from that
My lil' girl need her daddy on the phone at a certain time
Exact now, and niggaz act wild (foul)
But when the mac come out, y'all niggaz ex' out (blaow!)
And I don't wanna hear X-Y-Z
I'm X'in out your whole entity for tryin to kill me (me nigga)
Filthy motherfuckers, I'll show you what real be (real be nigga)
When these H-T-B's light up your kidneys (woo!)
I'm so sincere, you see in a hearse this year
It's not a verse it's a curse from birth and what's on your person over here
This is Obie hearin clear, niggaz beware
We're comin at you with firearms in air (yeah nigga!)
And your purpose so superfluous
How could I be merciful when murkin me's a mercenary's goal? (uh)
Nigga I got paper, I'll have ya ass urgently exposed (what!)
No emergency's bringin back your souls
Slugs shatter your bones for pat-pattin me in the dome
Learn this patter-in, we catch him at home, he wrong
That's when automatics sporadically catch him in the abdomen
Another +Dirty+ motherfucker's gone (YEAH!)

[Chorus]

Typed by: kirenamloh@msn.com

[singer playing piano]
Precious Lord...take myyyyyy-hiiiii my haaaaand...
Leaaaaaad me on...let meeeee, let me stand
and I-hiiiiiiiiiigh-iiiiiii am tired
and iiiiiiiiIIIIIII... and weak...
I-iiiiiiiiiii am worn-ohhohooohoohoOOOHOOHOHOHOHOWWOWOOHHH....

[Verse One]
Street child {?} in Moscow, in Russia
I'll rush ya, plans to pollute a city
My format pull four flat, like man holds in pitfalls
Pit bulls called through barks, blunts get sparked
To ease on down the tension, headbangin
box, Bronx big Willie, Los like Angeles
Scandalous street slaves, dark Carlway Caves
is where my apartment lays; a project doors
ripped off the hinges, mommy dearest arrested
in a drug bust, toilet sky flush
crack head lust - down the drain
Greenback's a must, thought I gotta maintain
in this hot land, I stand alone as a man
Who cares who hearts cries, took over drug spots where dad died
Pass the .45....to the death, lye...

[Chorus]
Precious Lord, take my hand
Lead me on and let me stand
Precious Lord, take my hand
Lead me on and let me staaaand...
Let me staaaaaand...

[Verse Two]
It's to 'til death kid, my heart beats strong for riches
Tryna keep it sane as I play the world's game
It's the, last year of my high school affairs
Sometimes I look back in tears, for all the years
it took to clear; but anyway plans is made
I gotsta blow up and fast, like the bomb in a sixth train blast
that's how bad I fiend, cash is on my mind kid
I wanna live my whole life reclined
Makin phone calls from cellulars, payin car notes to boats
Sittin back while I sip on floats, as I work the network
That's how I want my days to pass and times to last
So I meditate on which way I'll take, which door should I choose
or which path will lead me to a pock' fulla jewels; fools can only miss it
But yo I grip it to the DEATH when I get it

Song:   Presenting Miilkbone
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

	You know sometimes shit just gotta go down
	Eminem, you swung first, a-huh
	Death Row, Miilkbone, niggaz swingin next
	This is "Presenting Miilkbone"
	Watch your ass bwoy!!

(c'mon, knock it out dawg)

[Naji]	Yo why you runnin your mouth?
	Ahh you just upset cause my man dissed you
	That's all it took, peek-a-boo!
(Yo, didn't Dre take his beat?)
	From right in your face, I'm right here WHAT?!

[Miilkbone]
Yo yo I get mine mine every frickin time
I write rhymes like diamonds so now they call me Spit'n'Shine
I'm Miilkbone, blast disaster, no Mather could matter
Subtract Dre on his Day and y'all add up the Math-After
I shatter and splatter your bladded to pieces of feces
I don't believe this -- I'm gettin dissed by this musical Beavis
Stove-head rotten rhymer, crackpot designer miner
Chinky-eyed like China, fuck you nickel and dime rhymer
Hatin to love me, cause his watch is stud-free
You sippin, bubbly, but you rhyme, like Chub-bly
Go against me, rebel, time will tell, climb and rapel
down from a thousand heights like Super Son of Jarel, what?

Chorus: Naji (repeat 2X)

I said, *HI*, your name is *WHAT?*  Slim Shady
Since you actin like a baby then I guess without no maybe's
Introducin: Miilkbone, BAD TO THE BONE
Where the party at?  Where the Bacardi at?

[Miilkbone]
I'm shoutin out to Eminem, gassed like mopeds on a mountain
Dre gave you a couple dollars, and you a fiend, so why you countin?
I've been known to murder mics and make a move like your momma
I'm a master with the motive of emotionless type persona
Mentally massacre many, promotin mo' bass
I take Eminem motherfuckers and melt his muzzle with mace
Majestic Motorola, maneuver beats like MIDI
Mindset you beat me?  You need to know, HEE HEE HOW, like Missy
My melody mark, multiplied by millions, the mack tells
the miscellaneous methods of my music on Maxell
Manipulatin a whole masquerade of these make-believe MC's
Cause I'm Miilkbone, and I made mine
and you're mo' better on your knees

Chorus

[Miilkbone]
Meet the perfector, sweet like nectar, beef corrector
heat-injector, gap in your teeth connector, beat collector
Eminem, raindrops, Miilkbone, name tops
We both got bikes - I run out of gas and yo' chain pops
You want it?  You got it
We Bout It Bout It, you need to eat it
Nobody Iller with Thrillers makin Billie Jean Beat It, cause
I write like the future (I'm back) when y'all ready to read it
Repeat it: my pounds of bud, and yo' shit's heavily seeded
With the hotness, with the Loch Ness
Mr. Marshall, wanna watch this?
You act like you the package with these songs like empty boxes
Deliver my day to change, Miilkbone's the remainder
I make you famous sayin, "Hi - my name is Mr. Anus"
Yo, this Eminem shit don't melt in Dre's hands
It melts in his mouth - these crossdressin motherfuckers!

Chorus

Album:  Da Ambush - Da (Pure) Hip-Hop Compilation
Song:   Pressure
Typed by: jostmatt@bluewin.ch

He walked in the club, a million niggas givin' him pounds
While all the featherheads, they licked they lips and starin' him down
He's not concerned though, he fucked a few, but he got a main one
He used to play the corners gettin' panties till she changed him
He came from normal hood shit, hands was nice though
Punched out niggas' lights in most fights throughout live shows
He's arrogant a little bit cause the way he visions it
He holds heat but doesn't entertain the thought of gettin' hit
Swiftly dipped through the crowd and all the people there
Lookin' for his girl who had called him, told him to meet him there
Heard his name in a familiar voice but couldn't see from where
Walked in the direction of the sound and found her seated near
The exit, she grilled him and told him to sit
And started wiggin', said, "I see these chickens all on your dick"
He went to respond but she started laughin'
And said, "I'm just playin'" and askin' whether he remembered back when
They first met in this very club in these very chairs
Strugglin' to hear each other's words, music everywhere
He said, "Of course baby, yeah," she smiled and gave a stare
Said, "We need to talk, so let's walk and go get some air"
About a block from the club they locked in a hug
Son sayin', "We alone, now what's up?"
She said, "Close your eyes," but they both were surprised
When a gunman turned the corner, dressed in stick-up disguise
Shoved his lady to the ground and put the joint to his eyes
His life was on the line but what was even worse was his pride
Wouldn't allow him to go down without a fight, so he jerked back
Slapped the gun with his left hand, the hammer burst back
Ricochet off the wall, the gun fell, the guy bounced
Son went to chase him till he heard his lady cryin' out
Blood-covered belly, ring was barely hangin' from her flesh
Called a ambulance, two minutes later she's escapin' death
The medics said she's fine but she couldn't stop from cryin'
And her man couldn't understand why then
She said, "Close your eyes," and she whispered "surprise," he opened them
And said, "Damn!" In her hand was a blood covered sonorgram

[ CHORUS 2X ]
Under pressure how will you react, your hand's on your gat
But can you find another way of handlin' that?
When under pressure, no exit, in fact, the wall's to your back
Are you considerin' the consequence of your acts?

With one inside the chamber the youngster aimed his weapon at a stranger
An older woman randomly caught in the path of danger
Niggas said he ain't have heart, he was determined to prove 'em wrong
By makin' himself do soemthin' he knew was rong
On her chest he placed the barrel once he had the cream
Told her, "Turn around, lay down, you die if you scream"
Fled the scene powered by the butterflies inside his stomach
He was runnin' fast enough to win the Indy 500
With the gun in his waist he ran straight toward the place of his ace
Hopin' no good samaritan gave chase
Thought he was saved face when he told these niggas what he done
But they was like, "Man, go 'head with your bitch ass, son"
"Anyone can stick a old lady, you really on some thief shit
Then go and stick one of them next niggas that we got beef with"
He couldn't believe it, his so-called friends
Didn't appreciate the risk that he had taken for them
Nevertheless he plotted, once the nigga was spotted
He cornered him as he walked through the alley by his appartment
Nervously he clutched the heater as he tried to play cool
Took his money, made him run his ( ??? ) and ( ??? ) jewels
Jetted up the alley, believed that his duty was done
And in the process he didn't have to murder no one
At that second a bullet blast through the back of his lungs
In all his nervousness the kid forgot to pat for a gun
Another son and brother no longer among the livin' mass
The real problem's there's only a few of any who ask
Is it homicide of suicide that left his frame froze?
Was he murdered by that nigga or the path that he chose?
What degree of beef justifies blastin' your foes?
Caskets are closed while the number of casualties gross
From my block to yours, a similar madness we know
The saga of another kid ends tragically so

Skillz (uh-huh) E.C. (uh-huh)
Uh-huh, yeah, uh

Yo yo yo
If you was blind to the fact, then soon you'll see
Half of these rappers couldn't run through me
I'm from a place where outta state niggaz hide they rough
You believe in spirits, I'll put you inside ya'self
Ya hatin, I'm changin up the course again
Now ya like, "Damn, how he get up in The Source again?"
Man these so-called rappers is gettin real sloppy
Labels callin me, just wishin they could stop me
Meanwhile I'm spittin at a chick in the lobby
Two-tone Timbs, lookin like chicken and broccoli
Rap cats don't got what they need to stop me
Kick yo' ass and then we cool like Apollo and Rocky
My vacancy figures, hold my ground
Whole state-a niggaz, love the way I hold 'em down
Over your track, I'll floor ya
Have ya producer callin you like, "I got another one for ya"

[Hook] - 2X
So what's this? - The reason you ain't seein me
Now who are you? - Come on now, ya favorite emcee
Relax ya'self and let ya conscious be free,
and get down to the sounds of the D.I.C.

[Verse 2]
Yo my name, a name all crews'll know
Everytime I spit, your label lose some dough
So if y'all move three, we movin fo'
Fuck rap, I bruise mics and that's right from the do'
See it's like, I'm bout these hits strictly (Say what?)
These haters out here don't hit me, they gon' get wit me
You don't know a nigga breathin that's gonna out spit me
I got news for these lil' crews out to get me
I'm like easy pass before I drop
I might slow down, but I don't have to stop
You wanna see somethin hot, well pass the rock
You don't have to be turbo for yo' ass to get popped
Keep the stash in the spot while you hittin the leaf
Fuck makin it hot, I make it like fish grease
Timbs slick with the crease, get around that
And once I bounce on the beat, it ain't bouncin back

[Hook] - 2X

[Verse 3]
Aiyyo I'm Skillz dawg, the steel I be breakin
I don't give a fuck about the shit y'all makin
My crew spit nice and still get mean
Pop the clip out the mic and spit sixteen
Cats talk their head off for like an hour and shit
Niggaz be ridin ya sack and wanna borrow ya dick
Whoever y'all think nice, I heard of 'em all
Name ya top three rappers, I'll murder 'em all
Probably caught me at a light sittin low to the ground
Told ya girl, "Aww he act like he don't know me now"
Any city you can visit, I tore that down
Way above yours, that's where my flow at now
If I ever need loot, I long for figures
I'm in the parkin booth, ghostwritin songs for niggaz
Chicks call me a pigeon, but they ain't wrong
Cuz at any given time, they could get shitted on
Beats get spitted on, courtesy of Shaquan
I'ma keep talkin shit till y'all prove me wrong
Oh you still doin songs? It's all for nothin
All you gon' ever get from me is the fast-forward button

[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah, this me
I'm outta town but I'll be home soon, baby
I promise
Whatchu mean you don't believe me?
It's hard living this life I live
Just accept it, feel me?

[AZ]
I'm caught in a hole, I can't climb out
Caught in the mix cuz I think she's just found out
A year later, in the league like the majors
Blowing my cell, 9-1-1 on my pager
You know the flava and how it goes down
I move in and out of town
But honey now I'm homebound
Before that spot's gone you need to slow down, right now 
For better or for worse, how that sound?

[LaTocha]
I sit and ask myself
Is it really worth it
Or are you tryin' to keep playin' with my mind
I don't know why I keep dealin' with it
Cuz boy your love is wicked
And I'm so tired of those same old lies

1 - 	You told me that you love me
	You told me that you care
	Said you'd always be my baby
	How could you be so unfair

	Promised never to leave me lonely
	Promised never to leave my side
	Boy you turned your back on me
	Your promises were nothin' but lies

I can't explain the way I feel about this love
You left me all alone
Boy where did we go wrong?
Cuz all the promises that you made
Were words just spoken
How could you leave me standing there

Repeat 1

[Ray Buchanan]
Let the truth speak
Bought you a jeep and the coup, please
Beach world, crump every Sierra with two seats
For two weeks both had beef, it grew deep
Made me loose sleep 
Forced me to creep with this new piece
Outta town for a minute now
Damn near finished now, simmer down
I know you stressed and it been a while
Daydreamin' and Daytona sun stay beamin'
Sea blue ocean beach, new waves gleamin'

[AZ]
Meet me at the chapel with your mamma and your poppa
Bring the whole fam' and be sure to dress propa'
Your girlfriend's are jealous, that's why they tried to stop us
Eyes wide open when they seen the rock I gotcha
Bounce to Cancun, the cottage on the mountain
Then sailed to San Juan, come drink from my fountain
For all my wrongs, I beg your pardon
How could you end this when we just startin'
(Promises were nothing but lies)

Repeat 1

That you care, babe
That you lied to me, you lied to me
Oh yeah

Battle Axe up on the set
Mad Child up on the set
LMNO up on the set
Rob The Viking up on the set
Battle Axe up on the set
The whole world up on the set (3x)

Yo, many of nights, plenty of flights
Setting the mood without blacklights
Like 2000, they're a bunch of hype
Not fooling me, just another person with jewelery
I'm advanced like cash from the label
Except I don't run out creative stamina
And the complete control to turn this rhythm into listening pleasure
Huh, each and every measure
Beating off the pressure, destroying appetite
Not anorexic, man that's sick
We all have issues, this is true
Reach just a little, we all need to
Not quite the tree hugger
But I got splinters in my nuckles from knocking on wood
Superstition isn't good
At least for me, my father's heavenly
Like father, like son, strive for perfection
Since young, been dealing with correction
Seeking affection, honorary election
Clean inspection, mean infection
If you're that hard, you might just get etched on
Come on!

Chorus (2x)
Never kill, never will (can't say never!)
Defenders take one for the team...
Whatever comes my way...
Proper reaction
We come with the proper reaction

Sometimes it takes two to tangle, mad slaughter and mangle
Too hot to handle, I'm far from star spangled
Work the angles with this Canadian commando
Hard to understand us, Underworld Defenders
My new partner's plan is to follow the Ten Commandments
I'm working on it, but still living outlandish
Walk a separate path but speak the same language
Rough wranglers, we hit you with the bangers
Look, I'm off the hook, we rock with no hangup
Think fast, I've far surpassed you tape slangers
I think I'll hang around 'till I'm famous
I'm talkin' about lots more than knowing what my name is
Blame us for shining new light on entertainment
The odd couple, now that's a strange arrangement
Lone ranger, ???? from Perfect Strangers, and Swollen Members
Three names you should remember

Hello
What up?
Hello? Yo, I can't, I can't hear you
Let me call you back

I sense someone's tapping into my phones, why do
I got this feeling in my bones I might die soon
The FBI might be trying to pull my file soon
I might be walking blindfold into a typhoon
I might be seeing rockets light up the night sky
Right outside the window of my living room
And if they do you can say good night and by-bye to them iTunes
If I don't try to record as much before I do
The plan is to have as many in the can as I can
As I stand before you in this booth of walking dead man
Blank stair, dead pan, look on my face as I gaze into space
As I wait to be scooped up in that van
As I mysteriously disappear into thin air
And they gonna say a sniper just appeared out of nowhere
And I'll go down in the history
As the bloodsucking leech who hid behind the freedom of speech
Tried to take the 5th Amendment, use it, twist it and bend it
And ended up dying the villian, not the hero
Splendid, stupendous way to end this, I can feel the tremors tremendous
In remembrance of September 11th
Flash back to September 7th when 2Pac was murdered in Vegas
He said it, he predicted his own death, let us never forget it
Should we ever live to regret it
Like that day John F. Kennedy was assassinated in broad day
By the greatest lunatic with a gun
Who just happened to work on the same block in the library book depository
Where the President would go for a little Friday stroll
Shots fired from the grassy knoll
But they don't know, or do they
Who's they, for 'em to say, touche'
We're all vulnerable and its spook-ay
This is about as kook-ay, as I've ever felt now
Count down to nuclear meltdown
7,6,54,321
You can run, you can do what you want to
But you know you ain't gonna do nothing
When its time, it's your time
You are the prime target
You have become Public Enemy #1

Song:   Questions
Typed by: compbuttons@hotmail.com

[Thorough]
Hmm...questions
They all know the name and they all know the voice
But they don't know the face and that is my choice

[Verse 1]
Alright picture a dark room, I'm sitting at a desk
Puffing on a blunt, bumping this in my headset
Prepare to catch wreck, ready to accept
The next, who wanna try and test the vet from T-E-X
Confess up and get mess up like Mitch Green
What I'm writing, got em' fighting from here to Beijeng
So swing along if you can sway with the hardest
Leave me alone on the microphone cordless
Started a rapper and I plan to end just that
Give me the fortune and you can take the fame back
Whack MC's kill me with that flyness
But y'all can die quick now watch how fly that I get
The elegant, intelligent, forever been
Suave House federation, I represent
See I believe that it's a gift and not a myth
It just depends on how you use it and who you hit (blah)
Flip the script, turn the page, check my index
A mack out the Southwest getting his future set
Suspect fools make moves and get interrogated
Now they wondering can I really make it

[Hook 1]
Tell me, why you in the industry
You keep it real but it's your attitude in question
I see the fakeness in your eyes
Stop telling lies all the time
Be true to everything that you do in a rhyme
Tell me, why you in the industry
You keep it real but it's your attitude in question
I see the fakeness in your eyes
Stop telling lies all the time
Be true to everything that you do in a rhyme (That's questions)

[Verse 2]
Tell me how you keep it real, show originality
Do it for the love and not just the salary
I'd rather be a dope MC with the hunger to uplift
Than a joke MC with no purpose getting rich, now trip
Niggas is misguided and decided that astray be the right of way
Beg your pardon, if I may
It used to be hip-hop hooray
Now it's buckshots, p-p-pop, bodies drop when that gun spray
From what one say, 50 men can get killed
For trying to move into the house me and my niggas built
Blood, sweat, tears, blunts, and beers
Got me feeling severely sincere about my rap career
As I steer clear, past the frauds and scandalous broads
At times it's hard to show my whole bregard
Hoo gobs of caine, molest your brain like a masseuse
Life ain't a movie and people ain't bulletproof

[Hook 2]
Tell me, why you in the industry
You keep it real but it's your attitude in question
I see the fakeness in your eyes
Stop telling lies all the time
Be true to everything that you do in a rhyme
Tell me, why you in the industry
You keep it real but it's your attitude in question
I see the fakeness in your eyes
Stop telling lies all the time
Be true to everything that you do in a rhyme (That's questions)
Tell me why, uh baby
Tell me why, uh baby
Be true to everything, true to everything
True to everything that you do in a rhyme
Tell me why, uh baby
Tell me why, uh baby
Be true to everything, true to everything
True to everything that you do in a rhyme

[Verse 3]
Now this goes out to all you second rate speakers
Played out poets and smoke one, beat peakers
Break a ho like the 5-0, beat her
Two receivers, make you believe
That my flow is ether, flammable (Sss!)
Don't touch, so much verbal surplus
But them say it's not enough
As I rush rhythms, set traps lika a grappler
The greatest common factor with no use for math-e-matician
My system sir will blur your vision
Check how you living and then take a listen
We all on a mission, the objective is to live
And you get out the game, exactly what you give
As I forbid those who knock it and I rock it like Hancock
My mic is a hand block, making your can drop
Man, stop lying and tell the truth
Cause the things we do does affect the youth

[Hook 1]

[Thorough]
Yeah, what you in the game for
What's your purpose
Fame and wealth or do mean yourself
I don't know, Suave House the family
Uh huh, questions

[Fat Joe] Terror Squad!!
 
[Big Punisher] 
This is goin' out to the mothafuckin' punks and broke ass tricks
Don't Tryin' to come up in here
Up in here pumpin' that shit, I will straight blast you
You better break yourself mothafucker
Shit!! punk ass tricks, bitch

Take it hard --->  Eazy-E

Yo, kick it ---> Eazy-E

[Big Punisher]
Ruthless, plenty of that and much more
So at the party, Terror is controllin' the floor
That you step up and do your dance routine
It ain't a dream my man, you're in a gangster scene
With a villain, doin' damage on a 24 track
With confusion to finish my conclusion
Arhytomatic rhymes from a Radio cat
You can't take what I got 
Cause I'll be takin' it right back
Ruthless gangster          ---> MC Ren
Cold killin, you wanna know what it means? 
Definition... Villain       ---> MC Ren
With the stupid dope rhymes
And once you hear one line, you can tell it's mine
With a baseball cap that's black that I'm wearin'
And a look that keeps you all starin'
And wonderin, why I'm invincible
But when you hear my rhyme, it's convincible
I don't take no shorts, while I'm constructin' the ground
That makes you movin' around, from the hell of the sound
Girls drool on me like a dyin'

[Ant Banks] 
Pun, tell them what you do when your ass start rhymin'

[Big Punisher]
I go to the party, I hip and hop the spot
I don't know what it is, but the girls kept knock the aspirin' 
Like they're on fire and
Their so-called boy friends with them are retirin'
And for this reason I'm a walkin' threat
So when I step on the stage, I want quiet on the set

[Break: Ant Banks scratching inarticulated Public Enemy's quotes]

[Fat Joe]
Now to get started with my musical profession
A gangster feelin' in mind is in session
The way that I'm referrin to this, makes you move your butt
But don't stand in a daze, you should know what's up
Anyway, I keep the clappin' along
Cause nothin' bad could go wrong because this track is so strong
I'm like throw you the.. you can ask for anythin' more 
When the Terror Squad is cold rockin' the floor
Like stupid, actin' like a retard
Waitin' for a bumrush, gettin' to the good part
It tips me so with temptation
Writin' my lyrics with hyped information
This is just a section of my creation
So don't say shit with finesse fination
Just look at the center of the stage where the spotlight shines 
It's mine, unpredictable, keepin' you extremely enjoyed
It's irresistable, meanin' that you can't avoid
And while I'm on stage, feel forward to sweat
Whenever I rip it up, I want quiet on the set
 
[Break: Ant Banks scratching quotes below]
Yeah, what?, what? 
Terror Squad, Terror Squad
Yeah

[Unidentified Artist]
Now I can be loud as hell, you think I will? Never
Ssssht, quiet on the set  ---> Eazy-E 
Yeah, I like that better  ---> MC Ren
Word                      ---> Dr. Dre
That's what I can do, I think I earned respect
And if I didn't from you, that's what I expect
Cause if it ain't rough, it ain't me, it ain't me   ---> Eazy-E 
So who really cares how you want me to be?
See, I'm just me, standin' at the top of the pile
And doin' soft known tunes, just ain't my style
And this concludes our program
Of how The Terror Squad makes the Ruthless Jam
Now first, we take an average Gun
Give it to Pun, and the boy gets dumb
It's no secret, that I sit alone at night
Pick up the pad and the pen and begin to write
And lay down the lyrics that's promised to play
Hear everybody says:

[Break]
Check it in, check it out
Put it in, take it out
Make it out, yeah, Terror Squad baby
What?, what?, what?  

[Cuban Link]
Yeah, now Cuban Link is here workin' like super glue
No matter what I do, I'm always thinkin' of you
Cause I'm the pusher, supplyin' the fix
And this jam's so dope, it don't need a remix
But I'm makin' obstacles, an enemy traps
To catch any Emcee, with the weak-ass raps
Crucifyin' their data, cause you're usin' my name
The definition is pain, but that's the thing of the game
If they tried to retreat, I catch them one at a time
Cause they're comittin a crime, but still promotin' a rhymes
So, you're in the back of me, just listen and learn
Because you'll all get a chance, or maybe a turn
My sideman wants to give a preview
So at my next concert, I wanna see you there 
Not sittin' in a chair, standin' on both feet with your hands in the air
Now I'm about to get out, but I'll be back
But next time expect the more funkier track
Deep down for your enjoyment, to hear more percussion
With lyrics that's smooth, to start some discussion
To prove that I'm hype, now, you know that's a bet
So continue to dance, Cuban blew up the set

Verse 1:
Misery is it's own company uh ha
I'm not impressed by depressed MCs gettin' money
All ears on me exception guaranteed
Top Scotch quality cop on a dime
It's all on a line corrupt mind urban swine
Dash after we dine
And he kick flip and grind 
One of a kind be obedient 
Radiant flow around LMNO conditions met 
I think a helical get frolic without a wallet
Can't call it 
It's disconnect brah so just stall it
The patriotial blood he bleed so slow
Take L from his flow now we have another foe
Keep lyrics like gamblers with money to blow
I don't collect dust cause LMNO is always on the go
With Associates stay up Memo
Marty you know we shot the party no problemo

Hook:
They got all the answers yet they still don't know
People ask me all the time how to spell LMNO
Thinkin' all complex when it's quite simple
I don't get bitter bitter it's all refundable    (x2)

Verse 2:
Divide water like Jetties
I said these here without the man 
Proof of prophecies script in sand
So when the tide comes, foiled plan
New brand put it in stone it will withstand
Bix be known bandstand showcase
Embrace love and hate low rate hello mate
Bumpin' J-Rocc and tape
Schedule date is tentative as of late
Ja Ja create and also devastate
Grateful misshape right frame of mind
Keep 'em in orbit and keep out of any bind
I'm raining on the tennis match bust their parade 
Construction goes on look at what man made
Expert mediocre thought provoker
Gave a donation from my loafer
Hip hop's underground I'm a surface 
Gopher forever lit while physically sober
I cross over flood controls set goals 
On the account of ajusted souls

This is a funky expedition, a mission, I had a vision
Stop, look and listen, yo, isn't it something missin?
Take aim with precision like vision, it's a collision
New styles are hittin, b-b-boom, bash, forgettin
The laws, created by the creators
There's no more masters, just master-perpetrators
We did time with the rhyme like a bid
Now we're puttin out hits on the new fake kids

We're lookin for the gold

Ain't nothin we're afraid of, we're the Raiders of the Art

[ Kool Moe Dee ]
I'm like a diamond in the rough, too tough
You can't bring enough
Ammunition, vision or wishin
No need in bringin up
'The homeboy's-strapped-with-his-gat-
In-his-lap' crap
This is on the lyrical skills, you can scratch that
My lyrical skills makes mills, pays bills
And chills, all of the no-frill chills on the diznills
Now who cares who kills
When you got true skill?
I'm kickin the real, yet and still
Brothers flake until
My relevance flips the script
Dives and dips and hip-hops
And drops and give props
And knocks the kids out of the box and rips
Suckers to bits and kick knowledge and lifts the hits
When I get lifted, kid
Take cover, no mercy on a brother
He's kicked to the curb
Then into the street, then into the gutter
You c-c-can't win, n-n-no matter w-w-whatta
Even if I stutter -
I'm butter

[ Kool Moe Dee ]	We are the Raiders
[ L.A. Sunshine ] Of the Lost Art		(8x)

[ Special K ]
Time to pay the bills with lyrical skills
Built in time to lock deals
Crack seals, we build the real
Technique, unique technique
Did you really think
My creatively level would ever sink a level shrink?
Words are like missiles, bombs aim to hitcha, splitcha
So you better beware when you hear the sound of a whistle
Duck for cover, here comes a brother who lives in quadruples
And still does it youthful
And keeps away the display, expert rendition
Poetic, energetic, with vision and precision
Mystifyin, we're supplyin the funky stuff
Boogie Down Bronx, neither could fade that I'm tough
Rough on the floor, straight from the door
There's nothin phoney when the one is only kickin the verse, yo
Ask anybody familiar with my particular brand of funk
Tell em to pump it in the trunk

Way back in the days we lit a flame in this rap game
Groups like Tribe keep the vibe alive, and now the fire remains
Self-preservation is man's first law
I don't wanna start a war, but it's been done before
Almost like deja-vu with a sick twist to
An artform with warts torn, worn down, then run through
But don't gimme no credit, I'm a cash kinda guy
With my stash kinda high, still the girlies pass by
You know why? Cause I'm a Raider of this Lost Art
Played a big part from the start of hip hop, but now it's gotta stop
And if you go and check the archives, read the lines of the hieroglyphics
It says 'Sunshine's terrific'
As sacred as a golden scarab
Through my Creator I'm greater than the riches of a whealthy arab
The Sun shines in the east, so step from the west
On a musical archeological conquest

[Yazeed]
For years, we've been travelling the underground railroads
Freedom in sight, we travel through the night
despite attempts to keep us locked, mentally
Time to educate, and overtake oppressors
and RULE like we was meant to be
Poverty, projects, welfare, unprotected sex equals stress
Baguettes bring five you minutes of fame
Twenty-five years of death threats, no regrets
The prison moratorium project, keeps the isle in check
Can't forget, Black Panther Eddie Ellis
Black Power that devour, Redsauer society members
I enter, one-two-five, at the Community Justice Center
Logic Avenger, change, rattle caps
Dr. Cringer, blaze the stage with a controlled rage
Tone boots in cahoots with my troops
Indeed Yazeed's flow speed switches
which is fatal for these major labels
Hah, fables of incarceration affect Generation X
Cause and effect	(Yo, what's this nigga sayin?)
I'm sayin, to the government, more education
Less incarceration, less disrespect, expect
if you keep violating us, we'll have no other alternative
but to strike where you live

Right here and now is the ending of the lies
Thanks for listening, something's got to change right now
Right here and now is the ending of the lies
Thanks for listening, something's got to change right now
Right now..

Intro/Chorus: (x2)

What my homies gon' do when your sexin a freak?
(I'm gon' sport that raincoat!)
And what my ladies gon' do when you're gettin a piece?
(Make him sport that raincoat!)

Now what makes the world go round besides cheques
Everybody give it to me (S-E-X)
And if it's the bomb, it'll blow your mind
Even got a number, fool, it's 69
Coochie, coochie, coochie coo
Gotta little somethin that you all should do
Ain't no thang but a chicken wing
Sport a raincoat when you play in the rain

Chorus (x2)

Where your minds at, homies? Cos the old days passed
Need a lot more than a shot in your ass
Cure this stuff up today
Yeah, no syphillis, son, that murderer
A-I-D-to the S, take a guess
Where the brush stick and you might take a rest
Caught forever, there's no cure, not a bit
Dyin off quick cos you're careless with the dick
but umm, who's to blame? Say your name
and hope it feel good the last time that you play
Brushsticks and clits don't mix unless you're married
And nowadays, even that's straight scary
Cos a hoochie got a thing about fillin mad holes
So they good for the sex stroll
And it could be your best friend wit the quickness
So grab a firefighter about some business

Chorus (x2)

Now to the ladies of the world, here's a tip for you
When you're wit your homeboy and you're doin your do
He be runnin that trash, "You can trust me, baby"
Next time he say it, say "Fool, you're crazy"
It use to be diseases that could make you sick
but now it's diseases that'll kill you quick
And it do what it takes just to make it well
Cos sweet potato pie is the favorite dessert

Chorus (x2)

Outro:

Yo, yo, yo, this is a message to all the honeys and the homies
Ah, don't touch the rain without the raincoat
If you're down wit it, follow me

(Slug):
I'll take seven emcees, put ‘em in a line
Shoot ‘em and sell their clothes to get my wisdom teeth pulled
From here on out I'm grabbing these rappers by their fates
And throwing their destinies out into that lake
And as the earth shakes, and as the snakes eat
I found my birth place on top of that break beat
The beat breaks while I drink a red stripe to get my head right
Maybe put some life into this dead mic
You fuckers got nerve, you're lost between mold and the mildew
If you spit that verse with bullets and tits I wouldn't feel you
This plan can't grow without the nurturing and nutrience
So on I carry between the aryans and nubians (come together)
Holding a head full of that Minnesota pork
And if I ever blow up, I wanna fuck Bjork (you know my stink)
Let it rain, let it rain, let the water run off of the brain
Let the drops hit my shoulders and leave permanent stains
Let one solo drip touch my heart and symbolize what it contains
Restrain these thoughts that stay locked in my dark side
Let the bumper hit the pavement, pull away and let the sparks fly
Let the children have reason to laugh
Instead of needing to craft ways and passages to see their last days

(Sole):
As far as me and water animals are concerned are infantile
Past obliterating, great life on a scale, chorus boy
See if you died trying the diabetics
Bet if me and you had to breathe the same oxygen you'd choke
And foam comes out your headphones
And little men in black would scurry around and jump on dicks
Saying "Yo champ, keep the heads noddin'", I keep heads still
Steal moments from opponents lucky to find fabric in time
Between Nieche and Ice Cube
Fuck all of ya'll, never like any of ya'll in the first place
Punch face, dickhead, step on foot, burn bridge
Rape, pillage, take money
I saw your scribbles in the back of your last release, ha ha, funny
You bring your marbles, I'll bring mine
When our ego's and balls collide, you'll have some pre-written battle rhymes
But no, everything is cool, cold, icey, happy, glamorous
Let's all drink Zima and sing ‘We Are The World'
I am the world, where I am a whirlpool where all these fools get killed
Kilogram to your ass, and you bitch made like a quilt
Yeah I can drop down and neander with neanderthals and jelly fish
The revolutionary evolutionist, let me be the tooth fairy
Cuz when it comes down to bitin', I make damn sure everyone gets royalties
And rock Parliment beats instead of Jel's tracks
Shit, if I ever gave a fuck, I gave it away a long time ago     
Only time will tell, in due time until it's over
The pair of me see my parables, paragraphs and emcee favorite tongue
The world is my stage, and stage presence for everyone

Chorus:
Let it rain, let it rain
Let the gutter be the book you never wrote
Let the bottle be the drawbridge and moat
All this is soaked in the deep depths of Dynamics
All we ask is two ears and a planet

(Alias):
Developed materialist presented for your listening pleasure 
Quadruple phynetic spitters in two by ten measures
Profess my confession
I longed for this profession presently here
This art form ain't accessible
For those who want to hear us
Interlock hands through a sound and tape device through a filter
Constructing of percussion, rhythm sections, painstakingly built are
Infectious, totally overwhelming to soul and body
It's the Holy Ghost, making you physical structure appear quite shotty
Disassemblying, slow pick apart your sound taste
Deconstructing, jotted the four across the wall your forced to face
And conclude that your thirst is quenched by Deep Puddles
"Ay this shit is dope!", but our conversation to you is suttle 
You gotta hit that R-E-W when the fading commences
Your index extensions of your hand constantly tenses
Approximately every five minutes you will repeat this motion
Over and over until your mind's convinced of this notion
"Dynamics, I understand, and I pledge alliegance
To your music for advanced listeners covering many regions
And as far as I'm concerned, this group is number one
And who knew that using my brain could be so much fun"

(Dose):
Four, count them, one, two, three, seven, four
Pleasantly demented stock riders a few volts short of a paper airplane
Decided to sit ingrain, paint their faces and be leaves
Light green, turned upside down in the wind
Finally, someone to clap for, this toxic hermit grins
Especially men who look the globe over and back
Scratch, fizzlin' a balmy sky, it's time
If you live in the cosmos, milky way style
Say it like I mean it, to ease my hard head
And to where have you been my whole life, c'mon guys
Let's play the sap, shoot branch, off, shoot branch
But "hee hee hee" giggle the children 
Who's shot? Hands folded, pencils sharpened
Waiting patiently for quality birdseed 
And really cool camp counselors who know lots of big words
Once in a while it's fun to be smart
And play with matches on the dark side of the–Whoa!
Cock bang, young drummer get wicked
Smaller rock, and the larger ones all but confused
So with the prostitutes or platypuses
And grandparents fond on me
I'm a hydrogen molecule and proud of it
Let it rain....

[ VERSE 1: Masta Ace ]
Last month I spent two weeks on a vacation
I had a dream that I was inside of my PlayStation
Did you ever lay down, take a nap and loose it?
I dreamt I was stuck in this game called Rap Music
I started off underground in a dark room
With a freestyle, a sawed-off pump and a harpoon
That transform to a pen in case of a words war
And opened the first door that led to the first floor
I got attacked by a couple of rap acts
They wore dreads, these army pants and these backpacks
I hit one over the head with a broken verb
The muthafucka tried to hit me with some spoken word
But it didn't work, and I finished him and his boys
And disappeared from the scene without makin a noise
I used up four bars but I earned a punchline
And proceeded to Level 2: Land of the Unsigned

[ CHORUS ]
We don't play those games
Would you listen here?
What I'm doin here?
Get me outta here

We don't play those games
This is gettin wild
Can you tell me how?
Let me out now

We don't play those games
How'd I get in here?
Let me outta here
What I'm doin here?

We don't play those games
This is no fun
Got me on the run
Rap 2K1

[ VERSE 2: Masta Ace ]
I got attacked right away when I walked in
By a four-foot manager with a contract and a pen
I put up my force shield to block any attempt
At this shrimp drainin my life 20 percent
The floor opened up and I almost fell inside
But I used my mic right, I swung to the other side
And just when I thought I avoided the booby trap
I got slapped by a female MC with a doobie rag
And this chick was tryin to be herd like she raised cattle
But I remembered somethin I seen on the Blaze Battle
Whoever sold you them shoes, they fooled you
I killed her with a verse about her fucked up weave and her fake FUBU
A record exec then appeared in a black limo
And started to attack with a bag full of wack demos
And I will admit: it was hard as hell to kill
So I stabbed him with an invoice and a studio bill

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 3: Masta Ace ]
I made it to the next level: Above Ground
My soundscanner then picks up on this bug sound
I pull out the sawed-off pump and I get it cocked
And that's when this A&R crawled from under a rock
And start shootin opinions, I stop, drop and I roll
Cause if they was to hit me, they'd penetrate to my soul
I hid behind some trees and I held my weapon tightly
His street team was up on the roof tryin to snipe me
It took a while to finish em all but I finally did it
Then out comes this powerful beast known as the critic
With a fully loaded magazine and mad drama
My harpoon shots just bounced off of his armor
Now I wish I would've stayed down in the dark caves
I'm runnin towards these big-ass fans with these sharp blades
But he was right behind me holdin a flame thrower
So I jumped through the blades and I died - game over

[ Dr. Jeckyll ]
Good evening everybody, yes, I'm glad you're here
To all the people in the front and the people in the rear
Well, you're gonna have fun, did you expect to see
The number one master of the ceremony?
Don't care if you ( ? )
Don't care if you're 10, 20 years old
But when you hear this record you have a smile on your face
Cause we're the men that's gonna rock the place
We're like a peel of a lemon, juice of a lime
The same Bat channel, the same Bat time
Like the cold, cold ice that'll make you slip
I dibby-dibby-dive and I dive and I dip
Like the green for go, the red for stop
First we rock the hip and then we rock the hop
Like that merry-go-round or the rollercoaster ride
You listened to Jeckyll, now here is Hyde

[ Mr. Hyde ]
Now Carter's winnin the race right now, and Kennedy's not far behind
But they run into a new problem for the very first time
It seems Iran's holdin 50 people and will not let them go
They want the Shah in return, but Carter's sayin no
So they raised the price on gasoline for the American car
And while Khomeini's busy takin a nap the Shah goes to Panama
You see, he's a slick old man, can't ya understand, he's got too much money to die
He's makin Ayatollah Khomeini so mad the old man want to cry
Yes, we been easy on Iran and we love to retaliate
But we love to pick from the fruit of love and not bite from the apple of hate
But we Americans gettin sick and tired of this political gong show
So we're sendin our message over to Iran: Let our people go
Now we been pushed around a lot but we're not afraid of war
And Iran, your little cat and mouse game has really become a bore
So we're tellin this to you nice and slow, so you can understand
I walked, he walked, I jogged, he jogged, Iran, Iran, Iran, Iran

[ Mr. Hyde ]
Well, we are known from home to home
[ Dr. Jeckyll ]
And we're known around the world
[ Mr. Hyde ]
Yeah, we're known to fight the fellas
[ Dr. Jeckyll ]
And we're known to love the girls
So we hang out all night till broad daylight
[ Mr. Hyde ]
So we're known for sleepin late
[ both ]
But when it's 9 o'clock and we begin to rock 
[ Dr. Jeckyll ]
We're known to be the great
[ Mr. Hyde ]
So to the girls on the left
[ Dr. Jeckyll ]
The girls on the right
[ both ]
To the girls right over there
[ Dr. Jeckyll ]
You just remember one thing when you hear us sing 
[ Mr. Hyde ]
That we've got your love affair
And we want you to know that we're ready to go
[ Dr. Jeckyll ]
And we're set for a little romance
And when we rock the microphone can't leave us alone
[ both ]
Cause we'll put you in a trance
[ Mr. Hyde ]
He's the J-e-c-k-y-double l
[ Dr. Jeckyll ]
And he's the H-y-d-e
[ Mr. Hyde ]
Better now we got show and tell
[ Dr. Jeckyll ]
We got clientele
[ both ]
And originality
[ Mr. Hyde ]
So come on y'all let's have a ball
[ Dr. Jeckyll ]
Let's all have some fun
Baby doll, just remember one thing when you hear us sing
[ both ]
That you've got the number one
[ Mr. Hyde ]
Well I think it's time for Dr. Jeckyll to rock
So come Doc, it's your turn to rock

[ Dr. Jeckyll ]
I got a Ph.D. and a doctor's degree and I've studied around the world
Baby doll, but one thing I've read and I've always said, that I can only examine the girls
So when the ( ? ) comes and you catch a cold and you come down with the flu
You just have no fear, my lovely dear, cause Dr. Jeckyll knows what to do
I pick ya up and I fix ya up, I put you right back on your feet
So when Friday night rolls around again you be rockin to the beat
So if you want the best cure in the nation, look me up in my new location
I got a brand-new spot on 116th, it's called Harlem World
Where the DJ's rock and the fellas get loose and the girls let down their curls
So just take a walk down the corridor and you will not miss my door
Cause I am the good doc, just like Betty Crocker they always come back for more
So when you look around for my office door you see my name in big golden speckles
Says Chief Of Service In Charge Of Staff, the incredible Dr. Jeckyll
So when you come to my office you walk through the door, please remember to close the gate
Baby doll, cause when you come to see Dr. Jeckyll, get ready to operate
So go on, go on, go on, go on, aw, hey, go on
You just work the body, work, work the body
Baby, rock that body, freak, freak the body
If you could stop you would stop
But since you can't stop you don't stop
[ both ]
So you don't stop the body rock
[ Dr. Jeckyll ]
Females
[ Mr. Hyde ]
Don't stop that body rock
[ Dr. Jeckyll ]
Fly guys
[ Mr. Hyde ]
Don't stop the body rock
[ Dr. Jeckyll ]
Everybody
[ Mr. Hyde ]
Don't stop that body rock
[ Dr. Jeckyll ]
Cause I'm mean, I'm keen, baby, always good
I do my thing ( ? ) neighborhood
I'm just standin here, I'm chillin, I'm doin my thing
Cause I'm well off like the Burger King
But I don't peddle burgers or sell french fries
I'm just here, baby doll, to make your nature rise
Go 1, 2, 3, 4, Mr. Hyde, what you're waitin for?

[ Mr. Hyde ]
For those of you who don't know me well, hello, it's Mr. Hyde
I rock so hard, don't need credit cards, cause I'm known nationwide
I got a Cadillac Seville, two 89's and even a Rolls Royce
I got money in the bank, the girls in check and I got a vicious voice
[ both ]
Now when we feel what we feel
[ Mr. Hyde ]
It's hard for us to tell you so
Cause you may not be in the mood, girl, you just may not want to go
[ both ]
But when you feel what you feel
[ Mr. Hyde ]
You wanna keep yourself for me
Cause you may have a boyfriend that you don't want me to see
Now a lot of girls say it's a waste of time
[ both ]
Tryin to get Jeckyll and Hyde
[ Mr. Hyde ]
But if you keep us happy, girl
[ both ]
We'll keep you satisfied
[ Mr. Hyde ]
And it won't matter to us, girl, what your friend might say
Cause if you ( ? )
[ both }
We'll give your friend the play
[ Mr. Hyde ]
Now every day that passes by, every night I spend with you
You could teach me how to punk rock
[ both ]
And we'll show you how to Patty Duke
[ Mr. Hyde ]
And he may say sweet things and promise you security
But can he rock the microphone like Dr. Jeckyll and me?

[ Dr. Jeckyll ]
Well, before we go we just want you to know 
[ Mr. Hyde ]
Better who you been listenin to
[ Dr. Jeckyll ]
Check it out now, baby, baby doll, while I tell you, hah
[ Mr. Hyde ]
Who we are and what we do
[ Dr. Jeckyll ]
Well I am Dr. Jeckyll
[ Mr. Hyde ]
You know what girls, I am Mr. Hyde
We stay up all night till the broad daylight
[ both ]
Just makin our vicious rhymes
[ Mr. Hyde ]
We're two fly, fly guys and if you give us a try
[ Dr. Jeckyll ]
Girls, you'll be satisfied
Cause on the license plates of our 89
[ both ]
It says "Dr. Jeckyll & Mr. Hyde"
[ Dr. Jeckyll ]
So a lot of people often wonder why we're the number one
[ Mr. Hyde ]
Is while the other MC's try their best to please
[ both ]
While we're just havin fun
[ Dr. Jeckyll ]
So go up, down, round and round and then you slip and slide
[ Mr. Hyde ]
And just remember one thing when you hear us sing, you are rockin with Jeckyll & Hyde
[ Dr. Jeckyll ]
Females you are rockin with Jeckyll & Hyde
[ both ]
Fly guys you are rockin with Jeckyll & Hyde
[ Dr. Jeckyll ]
Everybody
[ both ]
You are rockin with Jeckyll & Hyde
So turn the record to the flipside

Song:   Rapper's Delight
Typed by: OHHLA.com

* organized by Rhino comp. for convenience regardless of original

I said a hip hop,
Hippie to the hippie,
The hip, hip a hop, and you don't stop, a rock it
To the bang bang boogie, say, up jump the boogie,
To the rhythm of the boogie, the beat.
Now, what you hear is not a test - I'm rappin' to the beat,
And me, the groove, and my friends are gonna try to move your feet.
See, I am Wonder Mike, and I'd like to say hello,
To the black, to the white, the red and the brown,
The purple and yellow.  But first, I gotta
Bang bang, the boogie to the boogie,
Say up jump the boogie to the bang bang boogie,
Let's rock, you don't stop,
Rock the rhythm that'll make your body rock.
Well so far you've heard my voice but I brought two friends along,
And the next on the mic is my man Hank,
C'mon, Hank, sing that song!

Check it out, I'm the C-A-S-A, the N-O-V-A,
And the rest is F-L-Y,
You see I go by the code of the doctor of the mix,
And these reasons I'll tell you why.
You see, I'm six foot one, and I'm tons of fun
When I dress to a T,
You see, I got more clothes than Muhammad Ali
and I dress so viciously.
I got bodyguards, I got two big cars
That definitely ain't the wack,
I got a Lincoln Continental and a sunfoofed Cadillac.
So after school I take a dip in the pool,
Which is really on the wall,
I got a colour TV, so I can see
The Knicks play basketball.  Hear me talk about
Checkbooks, credit cards, mo' money
Than a sucker could ever spend,
But I wouldn't give a sucker or a bum form the Rucker
Not a dime 'til I made it again.  Everybody go
Ho-tel, Mo-tel, Whatcha gonna do today? (Say what?)
'Cos I'm a get a fly girl,
Gonna get some spank n' drive off in a def OJ.  Everybody go
Ho-tel, Mo-tel, Holiday Inn,
Say if your girl starts actin' up, then you take her friend.
Master Gee!  My mellow!
It's on to you, so whatcha gonna do?

Well, it's on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on,
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn.
I said M-A-S, T-E-R, a G with a double E,
I said I go by the unforgettable name
Of the man they call the Master Gee.
Well, my name is known all over the world
By all the foxy ladies and the pretty girls.
I'm goin' down in history
As the baddest rapper there ever could be.
Now I'm feelin' the highs and you're feelin' the lows,
The beat starts gettin' into your toes
You start poppin' your fingers and stompin' your feet
And movin' your body while while you're sitting in your seat
And then damn!  Ya start doin' the freak, I said
Damn!  Right outta your seat
Then you throw your hands high in the air,
Ya rockin' to the rhythm, shake your derriere
Ya rockin' to the beat without a care,
With the sureshot MCs for the affair.
Now, I'm not as tall as the rest of the gang
But I rap to the beat just the same.
I got a little face, and a pair of brown eyes
All I'm here to do, ladies, is hypnotize
Singin' on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on,
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
Singin' on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on,
Like a hot buttered pop da pop da pop dibbie dibbie
Pop da pop pop, don't you dare stop
Come alive y'all, gimme whatcha got
I guess by now you can take a hunch
And find that I am the baby of the bunch
But that's okay, I still keep in stride,
'Cos all I'm here to do is just wiggle your behind
Singin' on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on,
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn.
Singin' on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on,
Rock rock, y'all, throw it on the floor
I'm gonna freak you here, I'm gona freak you there,
I'm gonna move you outta this atmosphere.
'Cos I'm one of a kind and I'll shock your mind
I'll put TNT in your behind.  I said
One, two, three, four, come on, girls, get on the floor
A-come alive, y'all, a-gimme whatcha got
'Cos I'm guaranteed to make you rock
I said one, two, three, four, tell me, Wonder Mike
What are you waiting for?

I said a hip hop,
The hippie to the hippie
The hip hip a hop, and you don't stop, a rock it
To the bang bang boogie, say up jump the boogie,
To the rhythm of the boogie, the beat.
A Skiddleebebop, we rock, scooby doo,
And guess what, America, we love you
'Cos you rocked and a rolled with so much soul,
You could rock 'til a hundred and one years old.
I don't mean to brag, I don't mean to boast,
But we like hot butter on our breakfast toast
Rock it up, Baby Bubba!
Baby Bubba to the boogie da bang bang da boogie
To the beat, beat, it's unique
Come on everybody and dance to the beat!

*Drum break*

A hip hop
The hippie to the hippie the
Hip hip a hop and you don't stop, rock it
Rock it out, Baby Bubba to the boogie da bang bang
The boogie to the boogie, the beat.
I said, I can't wait 'til the end of the week
When I'm rappin' to the rhythm of a groovy beat
And I attempt to raise your body heat.
Just blow your mind, so you can't speak
And do a thing but a-rock and shuffle your feet
And let it change up to a dance called the freak
And when you finally do come into your rhythmic beat,
Reast a little while so you don't get weak.
I know a man named Hank
He has more rhymes than a serious bank
So come on Hank, sing that song,
To the rhythm of the boogie, the bang bang da bong!

Well, I'm Imp the Dimp, the ladies' pimp,
The women fight for my delight.
But I'm the grandmaster with the three MCs
That shock the house for the young ladies
And when you come inside, into the front,
You do the freak, spank, and do the bump
And when the sucker MC try to prove a point,
We're a treacherous trio, we're the serious joint!
a-From sun to sun and from time to time
I sit down and write a brand new rhyme
Because they say that miracles never cease
I've created a devastating masterpiece
I'm gonna rock the mic 'til you can't resist,
Everybody, I say it goes like this
Well, I was walking home late one afternoon
A reporter stopped me for an interview
She said she's heard stories and she's heard fables
That I'm vicious on the mic and the turntable
This young reporter I did adore,
So I rocked some vicious rhymes like I never did before
She said, "Damn, fly guy, I'm in love with you
The Casanova legend must have been true"
I said, "By the way, baby, what's your name?"
Said, "I go by name of Lois Lane
And you could be my boyfriend, you surely can,
Just let me quit my boyfriend called Superman."
I said, "He's a fairy, I do suppose
Flyin' through the air in pantyhose
He may be very sexy, or even cute,
But he looks like a sucker in a blue and red suit,"
I said, "You need a man man who's got finesse
And his whole name across his chest
He may be able to fly all through the night,
But can he rock a party 'til the early light?
He can't satisfy you with his little worm,
But I can bust you out with my super sperm!"
I go do it, I go do it, I go do it, do it, do it.
An' I'm here an' I'm there, I'm Big Ban Hank, I'm everywhere
Just throw your hands up in the air
And party hardy like you just don't care
Let's do it, don't stop, y'all, a tick tock, y'all, you don't stop!
Go ho-tel, mo-tel, whatcha gonna do today? (Say what?)
I'm gonna get a fly girl, gonna get some spank, drive off in a def OJ,
Everybody go, "Ho-tel, mo-tel, Holiday Inn"
You say if your girl starts actin' up, then you take her friend
I say skip, dive, what can I say?
I can't fit 'em all inside my OJ,
So I just tak half, and bust 'em out,
I give the rest to Master Gee so he can shock the house
It was twelve o'clock one Friday night
I was rockin' to the beat and feelin' all right
Everybody was dancin' on the floor
Doin' all the things they never did before
And then this fly girl with a sexy lean
She came into the bar, she came into the scene
She travelled deeper inside the room
All the fellas checked out her white Sassoons
She came up to the table, looked into my eyes
Then she turned around and shook her behind
So I said to myself, it's time for me to release
My vicious rhyme I call my masterpiece
And now people in the house, this is just for you
A little rap to make you boogaloo
Now the group you hear is called Phase Two
And let me tell you somethin', we're a helluva crew
Once a week, we're on the street
Just to cut in the jams and look at your feet
For you to party, you gotta have the moves,
So we'll get right down and get you a groove 
For you to dance, you got to be hot
So we'll get right down and make you rock
Now the system's on and the girls are there
You definitely have a rockin' affair
But let me tell you somethin', there's still one fact
And to have a party, you got to have a rap
So when the party's over, you're makin' it home,
And tryin' to sleep before the break of dawn
And while you're sleepin', you start to dream,
And thinkin' how you danced on the disco scene
My name appears in your mind,
Yeah, a name you know that was right on time
It was Phase Two just doin' a do
Rockin' you down 'cos you knew we could
To the rhythm of the beat that makes you freak,
Come alive girls, get on your feet
To the rhythm of the beat to the beat the beat
To the double beat beat that makes you freak
To the rhythm of the beat that says you go on
On'n'on into the break of dawn
Now I got a man comin' on right now
He's garuanteed to throw down
He goes by the name of Wonder Mike
Come on, Wonder Mike, do what you like!

I say a can of beer that's sweeter than honey,
Like a millionaire that has no money
Like a rainy day that is not wet,
Like a gamblin' fiend that does not bet
Like Dracula without his fangs,
Like the boogie to the boogie without the boogie bang
Like collard greens that don't taste good,
Like a tree that's not made out of wood
Like goin' up and not comin' down,
Is just like the beat without the sound, no sound
To the beat beat, you do the freak
Everybody just rock and dance to the beat
Have you ever went over a friends house to eat
And the food just ain't no good?
The macaroni's soggy, the peas are mushed,
And the chicken tastes like wood
So you try to play it off like you think you can
By saying that you're full
And then your friend says, "Mama, he's just being polite
He ain't finished, uh-uh, that's bull!"
So your heart starts pumpin' and you think of a lie
And you say that you already ate
And your friend says "Man, there's plenty of food"
So you pile some more on your plate
While the stinky food's steamin', your mind starts to dreamin'
Of the moment that it's time to leave
And then you look at your plate and your chicken's slowly rottin'
Into something that looks like cheese
Oh so you say "That's it, I gotta leave this place
I don't care what these people think,
I'm just sittin' here makin' myself nauseous
With this ugly food that stinks"
So you bust out the door while it's still closed
Still sick from the food you ate
And then you run to the store for quick relief
From a bottle of Kaopectate
And then you call your friend two weeks later
To see how he has been
And he says, "I understand about the food,
Baby Bubba, but we're still friends"
With a hip hop the hippie to the hippie
The hip hip a hop, a you don't stop the rockin'
To the bang bang boogie
Say up jump the boogie to the rhythm of the boogie the beat
I say, "Hank, can ya rock?
Can ya rock to the rhythm that just don't stop?
Can ya hip me to the shoobie doo?"
I said, "Come on, make, make the people move!"

I go to the balls and then ring the bell
Because I am the man with the clientele
And if ya ask me why I rock so well,
A Big Bang, I got clientele
And from the time I was only six years old
I never forgot what I was told
It was the best advice I ever had
It came from my wise, dear old dad
He said, "Sit down, punk, I wanna talk to you
And don't say a word until I'm through
Now there's a time to laugh, a time to cry
A time to live and a time to die
A time to break and a time to chill
To act civilized or act real ill
But whatever you do in your lifetime
You never let an MC steal your rhyme"
So from six to six 'til this very day
I'll always remember what he had to say
So when the sucker MCs try to chump my style
I let them know that I'm versatile
I got style, finesse, and a little black book
That's filled with rhymes and I know you wanna look
But the thing that seperates you from me
And that is called originality
Because my rhymes are on from what you heard
I didn't even bite, not a go---word
And I say a little more, later on tonight
So the sucker MCs can bite all night
A tick a tock, y'all, a beat beat, y'all
A let's rock, y'all, you don't stop
Ya go, "Ho-tel, mo-tel, whatcha gonna do today?" (Say what?)
Ya say, "I'm gonna get a fly girl, gonna get some spank and
Drive off in a def OJ"
Everybody go, "Ho-tel, mo-tel, Holiday Inn"
Ya say if your girl starts actin' up, then you take her friends
A like that, y'all, to the beat, y'all
Beat beat y'all, ya don't stop!
A Master Gee, my mellow
It's on to you so whatcha gonna do?

Well, like Johnny Carson on the Late Show
A like Frankie Crocker in stereo
Well like the Barkay's singin' "Holy Ghost"
The sounds to throw down, they're played the most
It's like my man Captain Sky
Whose name he earned with his super sperm
We rock and we don't stop
Get off, y'all, I'm here to give you whatcha got
To the beat that it makes you freak
And come alive, girl, get on your feet
A like a Perry Mason without a case
Like Farrah Fawcett without her face
Like the Barkays on the mic
Like gettin' down right for you tonight
Like movin' your body so you don't know how
Right to the rhythm and throw down
Like comin' alive to the Master Gee
The brother who rocks so viciously
I said the age of one, my life begun
At the age of two I was doin' the do
At the age of three, it was you and me
Rockin' to the sounds of the Master Gee
At the age of four, I was on the floor
Givin' all the freaks what they bargained for
At the age of five I didn't take no jive
With the Master Gee it's all the way live
At the age of six I was a-pickin' up sticks
Rappin' to the beat, my stick was fixed
At the age of seven, I was rockin' in heaven
Don'tcha know I went off
I gotta run on down to the beat you see
Gettin' right on down, makin' all the girls
Just take off their clothes to the beat the beat
To the double beat beat that makes you freak
At the age of eight, I was really great
'Cause every night, you see, I had a date
At the age of nine, I was right on time
'Cause every night I had a party rhyme
Going on'n'n'on'n' on on'n'on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
A sayin' on'n'n'on'n' on on'n'on
Like a hot buttered de pop pop de popcorn...

(Billy Bavgate)

I never been a motherfucking caped crusader
Motherfuckers gonna hate me when I hit'em with this heater 
M-O-B, parkadas, fuck milly niggas
You never know when I might roll you up, and smoke you like a philly
Round Philly I do it till its done
Then I pass on down to my son, red rum
Now this kids get done
Cause livin' in the ghetto, niggas die over a hum bum
My lil' homie lost his life over drugs
Smokin' and Drinkin' with the thugs
And only niggas on the block,  show them love
So he don't give a fuck
Hooked wit da colonel til I die
'Till a nigga stick a revolver in my eye
Catchin Bavgate gettin' wet in a drive by
I don't know (buck buck) ask the man in the sky
Red rum when I ride
When I call up the colonel to come and get me 
Before them white folks lock me up for a century

Chorus
[Crooked Eye/(Billy Bavgate)]
If you wan't some then come and get some
(Don't make me empty out the 100 round drum nigga)
Red rum x4

(Crooked Eye)

Where we at, (where we at) 
Sausa pull his strap if he dump first
But the amature killers didn't know I'm puttin to work
Gave me the reason, commited treason, I wan't his head
Give me his family's bitch, his dogg, or I'm dead
He's marked my cousin
Came through on a sneak with a hit he bust'em
And Lord knows I loved him
Promise his son, I trust him
Heard his last breath, he said rise from my death
Then he shook and died, punched the cluck before my very eyes
Tramatized, thats why my head is all fucked up
I can not sleep, until these niggas are locked up
Red rum (red rum), runnin' wit dis 100 round drum
Huntin the niggas, who pulled the trigger on my closest nigga
Getcha figure, that in this game of pushin coke
It's kill or be killed, its like walking a tight rope
Got it tatted on my arm, nigga, written in blood
I won't rest til I put these niggas head in the mud
Red Rum

  "My world, is blue"

[talking]
[Cage] The fuckin Trump..
[Mr.E] Yeah cut it up, cut it up
[Cage] This ain't no, this ain't no bright lights and big city
[Mr.E] It's dark alleys, red lights and no pity

[Mr. Eon]
I got it, locked, stocked, and two smokin bongs
Got trees soaked and drawn, the mute grow dissolve drawn
Independent like Ralph Nader
When I hate y'all like Dallas Cowboy tailgators

[Cage]
I used to cut up my arms
Now 12 arms cut up my vinyl pawns
Fuck fawn, I get embalmed on the john
Then step onstage for encore
Stab the promoter with the pen from his Palm 4

[Mr. Eon]
East demenic, head dented, so devious
The most mischievous, check out the sleaziest
Deep in the dead of night, Peddlers getcha head right
This here be a soundtrack for the Red Light

[Cage]
Lick the side of my mouth out, see the words, gouged out
Letterin, hangin from the jaws, down stout
A verse in blood, that only hybrids see
And the non-creatives test my words fro HIV

[Hook: Both] - 2X
This here ain't no bright lights and big city
It's dark allies, red lights with no pity
For all-a y'all raw dawgs that get gritty
Stack ones, carry guns, and live shitty

[Cage]
You get the tip while I piss on the barcheck
Give a bitch some head that I pulled out of a carwreck
Am I angelic or just slightly off track
My bones shift when my ripped off wings flap

[Mr. Eon]
Now it's a damn shame
Don't even fuck with that bull that got Time Corp
coursin through his veins
Eon's called fierce, cuz he's all weird
Leave the fuckin record all cut up like Paul Pierce

[Cage]
My pain pour, quicker than Paul
Painful bulletholes that contain splinters from the front door
You seen how I did ya dawgs
Sent 'em home, souls collected, impaled on telephone poles

[Mr. Eon]
They all be catchin eights when I be slashin fakes
Makin fun of me? I'm still pullin out on classmates
With laser-guided missles that don't miss
Oh bitch, you don't wanna test when I hold this

[Hook: Both] - 2X

[Mr. Eon]
When the Earth is cast, it's fuckin gun ashes
With different aspects of microphone spastics
Froze elastic, ass kissed the tragics
Swimmin through ya petty bullshittin life jackets

[Cage]
For the most glamorous eat this shit raw
E.C. put Cage down like a sick dog
Now kids fiend for my solo LP
Like crack addicted Co-Flow fans, you just flee

[Mr. Eon]
Slayin drones, beat 'em up with sticks and stones
Stick with man-to-man, don't fuck around with zones
If I'm home or on neutral turf, when I blurt
You will hurt, this mics spurts when I smell dirt

[Cage]
I got a bullet with a name on it, dick got a blade on it
Lung got a stain on it, bottom-feeder get AIDS on it
I drop shit for the crowds to figure out
You touch the mic the crowd'll breath and pour they liquor out

[Hook: Both] - 2X

Song:   Remember the Music
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Follow my hands
I'll teach you how to play
I'll be patient with you
Someone who's patient with me

There always be a chance that you could hit the wrong note
Everybody could laugh and make you think you won't grow
You don't ever give up, it's not the end of the world

[Chorus]
You live and you learn
Even when you think that times get hard
It's temporary hard
All you gotta do is make that call
I'll be there
Don't be scared
You don't got to lose it
Remember the music
Remember the music

In the past it's been hard as hell
You don't know, know how much pain I felt
But everybody's got a story to tell
Sometimes you got to face the music and play by yourself

But there always be a chance that you could hit the wrong note
Everyone could laugh and they don't wanna hear no more
You don't ever give up, it's not the end of the world

[Chorus]
You live and you learn
Even when you think times get hard
It's temporary hard
All you gotta do is make that call
I'll be there
Don't be scared
You don't got to lose it
Remember the music

Remember
It's the answer
Don't you ever forget the music
No

[Chorus]
You live and you learn
Even when you think times get hard
It's temporary hard
All you gotta do is make that call
I'll be there
Don't be scared
You don't got to lose it
Remember the music

[KJ]
Uhh...
It's kinda hard when you think about the future
Realize the past really repeat, f'real
Uhh, we can see it in our music
Me, you can hear it in my beats (beats)
Yeah, they buy clothes for that old retro me
I keep it retro with my feet, yeah
So much for that soul that's gone (gone)
I guess I'll put it on repeat (repeat)
Repeat yeah, I love this music (music)
So don't ask me why I use it (I use it)
I use it for my personal outlet
Outlet's ma how I don't confuse it (confuse it)
One day you hot, the next day you not
Spoke about it with a lawyer who was Jewish
Consulted with him, about why do this again
Watch it the only way you watch it is keep it blue-ish (blue-ish)
Well, I keep a celly for the time
When I accesorize, I'm the subtle kind who do it
Probably cause, my money ain't long
And loans ain't paid off but ain't got shit to do with music
Hardly; music 'posed to represent life
And for now, life is a big party
So as I regulate the party (party)
I turn heads and make a move like a {?}
It's kind of hard when you think about the future
Realize the past really repeat, f'real
Yeah, we can hear it in our music
Me especially, up in my beats (yeah)
They buy clothes, for that old retro (retro)
I keep it retro on my feet (on my feet)
Yeah, so much for that sole that's gone
Gone, I put it on repeat (repeat)
Repeace, repeace

Niggas act like we don't represent
Man, them same muthafuckas ain't worth two cents

So fuck when I bust
As I, bill yo corner
So whatcha wanna, do
Rhyme wrecker, seems to me
This rap shit you neglect-a
Comin when I serve em with that weak work
You need that bitch, with your fuckin feelings hurt

[D-Day]
Never let em see ya sweat
See I be the vet
I bring pain but lame niggas seem to forget
See it like I see it, boy this shit stay phat
C.O.D.'s no V.D.'s boy they can't fade that
I keeps it crack cuz I can remember way way back when
Heard of rappin and thought the shit wasn't phat then
I'm back then, watchin these bitches scream they last ten
On these flip flop niggas, now do they ass in

[Chorus:]
When it comes to stackin chips you can't fade my shit
A-1 and Sick Wid It, we represent (They can't fade us)
When it comes to stackin chips you can't fade my shit
A-1 and Sick Wid It, we represent (Represent)

[Bone]
We put it down like the goddamn West Side connect
Put the noose on ya
Get to snappin the neck
I'm like Sub-Zero, wa-la
I make you freeze
I'm way to cold, nigga, don't fuck with these
My enemies, gon get our tape
And when it's like that, fool, there's no escape
We blaze this shit for cash and fame
So it's a must that you muthafuckas retrospect game

[D-Day]
Segregrated game and I blame my click
The flame I spit, fools try to change my shit
And get caught up in the rapture
Quickly I get they ass the crazy horse
Game playa man it don't fade us
There's something about the shit make they ass they pay
Just enough to keep a young nigga
We be in it for the long run
Don't get it wrong son
Can't fade what no bitch made
Cuz they be on point

[Chorus:]
When it comes to stackin chips you can't fade my shit
(You can't fade it)

[Bone]
I'm a neighborhood destroy-a
Prize fighter warrior

I'm a heavy weight I'll fold ya
Feather weights
Why do niggas, love to record hate
But you can't really hate all these A-1 cats
We spits the, you know, and gets down like that
Put a dent in your hub cap
From the base and when you're done with your list
I'ma spit in your face
Because you didn't have no weight
Yeah man I know you got it

Standin there like a goddamn statue
Mouth wide open, hopin that we fall

Shoulda caught some real dope, from Sam Bostic

[D-Day]
Look here I play ya and I pay to get
Bitches leave as I be correct be in this shit
I move so slow, you off bread niggas can't peep the logo
A dash 1, Sick Wid It in it like a photo
Take a close look, it ain't the same, don't trip
From the brain I tame, slang game when I spit
Tryin to get it while I'm in it, to floss with my niggas
Commited so I hit it for falsified niggas
Everything I bring though, for my profit
As I clock it, niggas know they can't stop shit
I keep it open like a (??) truck
Hump it like a (??)
Coming with this mob ass shit to make your trunk bump
Seriously about a year, best believe that though
Feedback though, as I let my G's stack more
I serve a menu as I continue to get upset, dog
And I represent and spit it from camp, fuck y'all

[Chorus:] X 2
When it comes to stackin chips you can't fade my shit
(You can't fade it)
A-1 and Sick Wid it, we represent (That's the way we represent)
When it comes to stackin chips you can't fade my shit

Blow indo out the window of my limo
Sleeping wit my in my pillow 
I really don't give a damn who u are 
Understand it u dealing wit a shooting star 
Competition never heard if I hit permanent 
Did I murder it, affirmative
The urban kid learning quick by earning grip 
Got mo eight ball then a pool tournament 
Swerven and lurvin, still cadilakin, still pack the Mack 
And still by no rapkins 
Drop like joranamo got piranha flow
You'd of been to young but yo mama now

Still, staking dead presidents

Whooplex get props on mesements 
No referees selling cheese, enemies, memories,
Yes ory rest peace, been that way for centuries
Dead chemistry, a blessed fiend

Got family, try jakin me
A lot of fun that'll be 

Chorus: 2X

White pasta, steak and lobster 
Sauté shrimp five different sauces
Crawfish, sausage, even Ostrich 
Watch us run from the crack monster
Conciense, of the world that lost us 
My Nina roisters, wonder what to cross us
Balers don't care what u call us 
Living caucios taking no loses
Own my own office, got no accomplice
The thought of us just makes me nauseous
Promise mom this time its honest 
Drop hits and make legitimate profit
Knowledge, from the street college
Reach for the top, just watch the copas 
Imposters hate true mobsters 
Cause we lost trust and we all bust

Don't need no more baby

See we can walk through the streets, politic all night
Start to make our own tracks, for these cats to recite
Recite, rip through your jugular vein, right out your throat
Make these cats wanna provoke, I'm holdin it down with my folks
Cause we walk about it, with Helamic and Knowledge
Shinin bright like a diamond, sittin in BK rhymin
Holdin it down, waitin for the sun to set now
Look in the sky, see my man B.I.G. floatin around
One day we shine so bright, livin life so right
Lost my man tonight, settin it off, aight?
Check it like this, you got to go with the flow
Some people may not understand, but you know how it go
Because life ain't shit, you got to work for yours
Got to hustle from the bottom just to feed the poor
Niggaz think shit is funny, got to work for yours
See the rich get, rich, the poor get poor
Jump up and grab the nina son you gotta get yours
Life ain't shit, got to work for yours

[Paw Duke]
The elements of life, got a nigga scared to death
I'm up to my neck, and I can't, hold my breath
Who woulda ever thought, at 22, goin through this
My young thugs bust guns, it's kinda foolish
My young ladies sell sex, it's kinda clueless
Let's get through this, illuminati's tryin to screw us
Blood for blood, ash for ash, life is bigger
The poorer man poor, while the rich gets richer

[Ed O.G.]
A lot of niggaz think that pro-black, is so wack
Like the old school I'm a throwback, you know that
We plantin seeds that don't grow back, while the black
still shinin like Kojak
You ain't never gave a shit, yo we OWNED that
Monopolize the whole game and control that
A lot of cats get scared so they hold back
thinkin that they won't get paper sayin pro-black
But they think they get rich screamin blow gats
bubble cracks on hot produced tracks and still dispute facts
I ain't tryin to hear another nigga schoolin me
bout my paper my car or my jewelry
And who is he?  The one that tell you not to spend it foolishly
Cause this whole black movement, is movin me
Keep your head above water, or drown below
On the dee-low, not cool to have a P.O.
You shootin craps, not cee-lo
Small time hustlers, who never reach the kilo
You know the steelo

[Chubb Rock]
From the committee of 300, niggaz can't get blunted
The JFK niggaz, UHH, died in cellblock niggaz
From the crack lackeys, hold your asshole and cock backey
Warm green eggs in pens sweatin like pigs
Niggaz get clockwork for five to ten blockwork
then cry for balance, then toss the salads
of the long wrong life, beaten knife, wound cabbage
Green veil niggaz at night, for bail adage
Tim Allen bend, went to the pen, for twelve pounds of M
Home Improvement now rules the zen
Charles Dutton locked for eight moons for nuttin nuttin
Came back tougher than Martin Martin for fuckin
The Guiliani's, Armani's, who laundry
the ducats from the Mexicans sweatin niggz from Rahway
How the fuck can street crack rule the NASDAQ?
That's like a rap nigga getting a check from ASCAP --
-- can't happen, after Attica rule the Richter
The poor went raw and the rich got richer

[Lil' Dap]
Because life ain't shit, you got to work for yours
Got to hustle from the bottom just to feed the poor
Niggaz think shit is funny, got to work for yours
See the rich get, rich, the poor get poor
Jump up and grab the nina son you gotta get yours
Life ain't shit, got to work for yours

[Chubb Rock]
Uhh! Uhh, uhh, nineteen ninety-nine
Huh huhh, with my rhyme

Nigga we boss up, Ride or die
Look at us lay low ridin by
Fuckin wit us might cost ya life
Nigga we boss up, Ride or die

[Verse 1: Spice 1]
I heard one bitch nigga scream get the gat, Get the gat
So I dumped on his homie like blllat blllat!
Tryin to catch you slippin but I always end up pistol whippin 'em, whippin 'em
Hittin 'em, Stickin 'em, Puttin clips in 'em, Clips in 'em
Hittin 'em wit the 45, Motherfuckers be buried alive
I doubt that you and them bitch-ass niggaz you rollin wit gon survive
Bust in his eye, I'm comin, Steady pumpin the fire
Rumblin by, Niggaz run and stumble and die
Bitch, I'm savage, You niggaz is butter like popcorn
I hopped on the hood of his caddy and chopped on him
Through the front windshield, Nigga you should've been peeled
Snatch 'em out the seat, Put 1 in his dome, A done deal
We bossy, We ain't nobody's boys, Strapped and armed
When you so motherfuckin soft, Niggaz wanna squeeze yo charmin
Little honey blunt dipped-ass cupcake nigga
They knew i'd shoot it up, So they planned yo wake quicker

[Tray Deee]
Hit the do', When I open, When I came to get in
And i'dve kick the motherfucker straight up off the hinges
Nigga challenging my talents is a sentence to death
Cause I'm steppin in a battle wit a clip in the deck
Crip is the set, So you ain't gotta ask if I bang
Deadlier than threat, Be drivin long beach niggaz insane
Bringin heat to any table that I step to eat off
Top dogg of that street, 21st so keep off
When I'm on the mic, Other rappers just speak off
Matter fact, Shut the fuck up and just ease off
I'm mobbin wit my speezies from the bay all day
Catchin felonies, Cause my lyrics stick like shanks
While the funny mc motherfuckers spit like blanks
Droppin cavi out in cali, Shit that hit like quakes
Ball out, Crawl out, Before you catch these vapors
Dogg house, All out, Keep it gangsta, Gangsta

[Chorus] 2x

[Verse 2: Yukmouth]
Nigga we savage, Raggin tighter than lions, Crazy life
You know we violent, Niggaz get stole on like kobe's grindin
In this game, You gotta move in silence
Saw big on the news blind red sirens
That means yo crew dyin
Bulletproof 22's grind pick up grindin
Duckin and divin, Runnin for their lives, No shuckin and jivin
Outside, Where niggaz be hustlin runnin
Motherfuckers strugglin and strivin to be that next head bubblin
Tumble like me, In fatigue, Kamo kaze
Smoke weed, Until my eyes bleed, Kemo sabi
'Proach me, Tryin to rob me, I'ma bop he
Make 'em scream like Bushwick, I went and shot you in the body
Probly, But you a bitch, I'm a nigga wit a tommy
Copy, I'm a hustler, You a snitch like johnny
Copy, I'm that nigga Yuk, Sick as fuck
Gettin head in a nine six truck, Bitch nigga what?

[Jayo Felony]
It's summertime back in my city, They think they can see this here
But y'all gon have to get wit me and deal wit me this year
Yo career is like chump change, I'll put it in the cup drop
And give it to crack smokers fat back on 47 block
Ya had to put somethin wit it to buy king cobra
Catch ya smokin stress, Weeded bizarre, Then smoke ya over
Nigga, I ain't goin wit y'all, Cause y'all niggaz is gang bangers
And I ain't no gang banger, But now, You'se a gang banger
Fashion crip, You know you been afraid
You just tryin to let yo hair grow but the scalpel's too tender for braids
And if you was a baby, I'd smash my finger through ya soft spot
I'm hot, Dumpin out in the open on 1 shot
Catch 'em on 33rd street, Cut off his bird peak
Don't make me turn clay street into ak street
Ever since I blew up, Seems like these bitch niggaz is mad
But now, I gotta pull ya covers back bitch, My memory ain't bad

We're baaack!!! Hahahahaha
The Untouchable Death Row
still platinum-plus on you bitch made niggas
Uhh uhh, DJ 2 Tuff baby
Yeah uhh, check it out (Death ROW)

Chorus:

You can ride or get rode on, rode on
You can steal or get stole on, stole on
You can stomp or get stepped on, stepped on
You can creep or get crept on nigga!

(You tried to ride) But in the process got rode on
(You tried to steal) But in the process got stoled on
Now tell me dogg how you want this to happen?
We can start rappin, take it to the streets and start strappin
Gobbles be yappin, I cut their tongues off, if not
I have everybody when they spit it out their mouth
Now what you thought, that I'd be too desperate with the truth?
You spoke up on this devil, now watch me improve to you
I bring more ??? to this game than Bryant Gumble
I hated to rob, sorry keep it down to a mumble
I'm just a step away from being America's most wanted
but the doggs in my coon that roam is full bloody
Who done it? Boy, I swear I'm bout to start gunnin
Those who never seen it comin, start runnin
Deliverin buckshots and low blows
So ride on with these Habitz and gotcha back stranded on the Row

Chorus (x2)

I come equipped with two 9's and fo' clips
Everytime I bust and leave burns or fo'-fifths
Then you run like Miller, on the hunt like Matilda
Abolish MC's, terrorise the Earth like Godzilla
Don't slip, I'm the skinny nigga with the phone grip
I represent Cali, 'stead of the Bloods and Crips
Slug protect, and we known for loot
There ain't a hood in Compton that ain't down with suit
I'm a ridah, fool that loves to ride
I'm not Sinbad, I never lose out on a vibe
I be the one to bomb first, put your ass in a body bag
wit your bloody rag, you fucked around and made me mad
So why you tryin me?
I leave you ride or get rode on like Kane did on Menace II Society
(Young blood you bold/bald) And I'm never gon' fall off
Don't give us niggas the silent treatment, you can't call this dogg off

Chorus (x2)

Bridge:

If you ride for me, I'ma ride for you
If I get rode on, I get rode on too
If you ride for me, I'ma ride for you
If I get rode on, I get rode on too

Interlude:

Hehehe, young niggas don't want no problems with Bad Habitz or Death Row
It's on the real, nigga, we comin for you

Niggas be like "Damn dogg, it's dem again"
We can jump into some gangsta shit or settle it like gentlemen
Love To Love You like Timbaland
I draw heat and bodies gone multiply like water to Gremlins
Plus I rush niggas off adrenalin
Catch big cases, murder off of big faces like Benjamins
Are you crazy? You must be
cos I'm pullin Glocks while you niggas throwin rocks like it's rings
I made you believe hell's hot
Who got shells? Hot shells, I shot shells and left you shellshocked
You niggas doomed in the dark from my 9 milli boss
Better ride on these niggas like an amuzement park
You sneak a ride on our ridahs and I, kill killers
Some hardcore like Keith, on all hammers, on three-wheelers
Niggas get destroyed battlin me
You have a better chance of catchin a Willie D with teeth like Leroy

Chorus (x2)

You can creep or get crept on nigga........!
You can creep or get crept on nigga........!

Boy come on, take a ride with me
And let me show you, the dirty 3
Pack your bags, don't forget your heat
Cause it go down, in the dirty streets

[Mafia Mike]
What you say boy, I don't play boy
Get up out my way, before I get out my K boy
With no delay boy, I'm bout to spray boy
Cause on these streets, your ass will decay boy
We want more chips, than Frito Lay boy
It's rough on this side, fuck where you stay boy
My niggaz is gorillas fa sho, ok boy
We can go to war, with it all day boy
You get it out of line, you better go and pray boy
Give you the casket, and the flowers to lay boy uh

[Hook - 2X]

[D-Reck]
I don't know if you done heard, but this the land of yay and herb
Where you can get served, every day on every curb
So nigga what you want, cause fool I got it
And if I'm out of pocket, I can tell you where to find it
Everything from cocaine, to fine ass dames
Rovers that Range, big Benzes wide frame
Propped up on thangs, pop trunk with the bang
The hustle and the game, and the piece and the chain
Got diamonds against the grain, candy coated paint
Got the wet and the drank, the X and the dank
Got pressure on my brain, from this task-4 stangs
Got hoods and these gangs, with these gats that flame
The joy and the pain, sun and the rain
Fortune and the fame, some of heat be scorching mayn
Hotter than Kayan, and her little sister Anne
Raging cajun cooking, will make a nigga say man

[Hook - 2X]

[Lil' Shay]
I hope you get the picture, cause it's on TV
Take you to a place, that we call the 3
Gucci frames, bad dames in 3D
In a city, hustlers in the VIP
Big clubs, big thugs big drugs
Parked outside, big trucks big dubs
Southside Tex, Lil' Shay gon ride
I-45, till the day I'm Northside
Eastside, Westside got hoes
Love it when they put they lips, where they don't belong
S-Class gator, play hater on the block
Want a house on the water, and a boat by the dock
Lil' Shay baby, don't bar no plexers
Boys round here, powered up on X's
It ain't all about your horses, spurs or your Lexus
We gotta keep it playa, Wreckshop Texas-Texas

[Tela]
I grab the chrome from the shelf
Cause it ain't nothing like left
Your last step or should I say your last breath
G is past death
Do us part when you fucking with that Suave - House
Here, click whenever you on that corner
Bitches born from the south, tremendous doubt
But I ain't tripping, how I'm living
I get to dipping
From 96' to 2000 back to the thresh holds of Olympus
No limits, heaven forgive us, we was born solely sinners
Continuous, extraneous with this, cold as quitters
Oldest niggas, still they be like acting like such
So I ain't giving a fuck, with chances to clear the shit up
For what, I seek steel, I get stuck
I play jacks on the year like Bill Rodell, get hit by a truck
Bent the fuck back, despite the worst day handle my shit
Son be scared to make that cheese, see I ain't afraid, I ain't like that
So hit code red, that's what I said, straight ahead
Let's get it on, break some bread, toast some wine oh yeah

[Hook]
Rider, I just want to ride
Pass me a lighter, pass it to me, won't you pass it to me
Rider, I just want, I just want to ride
Pass me a lighter, pass it to me

[Tela]
Let's party like for the soldier in the paint
Who's down to pimp a bitch whatever it be to make your bank
Shirt is off shorty, let's drank, crank, get crunk
Ain't no tanks in my trunk with some pumps
Just some chrome and such
And you can break the seal
On top of the wood on the bottom, that's the one's that are real
I can feel attention
It's all around me when I'm flipping at home in Memphis
Mentality, doberman pinscher
Not to mention that my ride stays out of state
And that my mind state is out of state
So they try to hypocrate
Setting voodoo, like in the movies
Giving me hell, call me Denzel
Chasing pipe bombs through A-T-L
But I prevail, cause I'm the best one, unconditional
With a high tech vest, maintain these little unknown body bags
Blast through sheet metal, and disappear
Come back, as a street weapon wearing some Suave gear, niggas unprepared

[Hook]

[Tela]
I sets it off, in the center of the spot
It's getting hot, even in the winter I make it thicker than sheet rock
The plot I'm plotting, has got you open, hoping, scoping
That you can keep up with the flow that is spoken
No choking, I'm soaking, like collard greens, it seem
All this game of, where I came from, done seen many things
Bring killer niggas around me, shotguns in the county
Bounty hunters with runners, 5-0 bet em' they can't find me
Wanna blind me and my diesels, with my peoples behind me
Grind and grit to the bone, I'm stacking paper till I'm gone
Phone, house I'm getting, while I'm on the pot shitting
Trying to figure out a way to get better on Thanksgiving
Plymouth and powder rocks get dropped
So it don't take but a second for me to fuck your whole block
Stop, but I can't see I'ma ride till I die
Nigga S-U-A-V-E tatooed down my spine

Ronnie and Gotti, at the party
And we're looking for some mami's
And we in a, big body
On some twenty inches, gliding
Noke and Salih, at the bar
Tyte Eyez, talking to a stallion
Reck and Dollar, just walked in
And Big Moe is on a gallon, we thoed

[D-Gotti]
I turn her head to the back, on Dubs
Strut in the club, on-on and out of drugs
I'm a thug uh-huh, my words spoke clear
Ice poked in my ear, people looking over here
We ain't sipping on beer, my Sprite's spiked with punch
And might light a blunt, if the bouncers don't front
Homegirl, I'm giving the Shop game at the bar
And I know she know, I'm a star
Mami on, you ready to split
Take your partna's ride, me on Ronnie be in the whip
Believe it it's real, with some wheels to buy
The dugout now, know what I'm talking bout

[Hook]

We thoed, we thoed
Thoed in the game

[Ronnie Spencer]
Everybody riding fly
First class, in the Dirty South
We wrecking Shop tonight
You know, our hits are tight
Big Ron, gonna make it wet
V-12, moving like a jet
Soon as my flight touch down
You know I'm gonna clown

[D-Gotti]
Crawl back on cutters, fin to flash jabos
To a girl do put your feet, on your mama's sofa
Mami hold up, hit the back with your friend
You're in the front seat in Lorenz, up in the wind
Chickens up in the Benz, I got visions to win
Soon as we get to the pad, the rules about to bend
Excuse me, could you please exit I'm through
Ronnie just two-way'd me baby, and he through too

[Ronnie Spencer]
Y'all cocked piece deuce, gator boots
Two scoops of crushed ice, line and locket
Trunk on glow, Southside fa sho
Rubber band wrapped notch, stuffed in my pocket
Jaws locked tight, it's Friday night
Ron-O, I'm bout to get expensive
Noke D Tahoe, candy syrup
So wet, it's Jason with the biscuits
Wrecking Vet, with china set
She fix it, right behind the label
Exotic, expensive clothes
With diamond karats, in her navel
We thoed, we thoed thoed in the game
Everybody riding fly, first class in the Dirty South
We wrecking Shop tonight, you know our hits are tight
Big Ron gonna make it wet, V-12 moving like a jet
Soon as my flight touch down, you know I'm gonna clown

We thoed, we thoed
Thoed in the game

Big Moe is drinking a gallon

[Blitz]	From what I see, the streets are closing in
	Systems holding men
	Captive, trapped in a holding pen
	Controlling men
[Lake]	From what I see, the hustle goes on
	Niggas with stress stay strong
	A nigga gotta eat right or wrong
[Blitz]	From what I see, the streets are closing in
	Systems holding men
	Captive, trapped in a holding pen

[Lake]	From what I see, the hustle goes on
	Niggas with stress stay strong

[Blitz]
Finally the gates cracked
Inhaled a fresh breeze that took me way back
To days of freedom, son we gave 'em seven even
Now a free man, prepared a steep plan to see grams
Without having to deal with lose grams and unmarked vans
Tell me your focus, it seems you like it when police provoke us
Lead to us grabbing toasters, shoot to kill when they approach us
Instantly tag us, no respect when they bag us
Throw us on the wall, feeling niggas up like they faggots
Hit you where it hurt, kick in ya door
You on the floor, they up ya wifey skirt lookin for raw
What is it for? Just for doing dirt tryin to score
You broke the law, you just put in work
Son in one shot you lose it all
Nowadays I never lose sleep
Yo Lake, I thought you knew the game was too deep
Son the streets pray on niggas who sleep
Keep it up son and you'll be fourty two in the pen
With consectutive tens waiting ya turn to do this again

[Blitz]	From what I see, the streets are closing in
	Systems holding men
	Captive, trapped in a holding pen

[Lake]
Hold up dun you buggin cuz, all of the sudden
Now you acting like these niggas don't owe me nothin
You frontin, no you changed nigga, you ain't the same nigga
At all, what up Blitz, huh? You afraid nigga?
My word I hate niggas, like you
Who do a bid then come home and go back to school
Thats weak, I'm gon' hustle to eat 'til I die
I don't give a fuck about writing no rhymes
Cuz I grind for mines, got a bubble Benz from it
Ya'll thug niggas thats trying to rap aint got nothin
You playin yourself trying jump on the stage
With ya young ass gear, damn near twenty eight
Just face it, its too late you missed ya shot
So forget about Blitz turn back to poppin
Come hit the block and puts it down
Thats word to spit I ain't feelin you right now

[Blitz]	Fuck you nigga, I'm writing rhymes
[Lake]	I'm choppin dimes
[Blitz]	Shit, I'm layin low
[Lake]	I'm tryin shine, nigga fuck rap
[Blitz]	Nah, nigga fuck crime
[Lake]	I know I ain't wrong
[Blitz]	Nigga, you know you ain't right

[Blitz]	I'm writing rhymes
[Lake]	Nigga, I'm choppin dimes
[Blitz]	Shit, I'm layin low
[Lake]	I'm tryin shine, nigga fuck rap
[Blitz]	Nah, nigga fuck crime
[Lake]	I know I ain't wrong
[Blitz]	Shit, you know you ain't right

[Blitz]
My hand to Black Ed, the life of crime and slingin crack's dead
For me, its either music or clap feds
I see it in your eyes you ain't changed duke, you ain't learned shit
Still flippin, runnin with young G's ready to burn clips

[Lake]
You fucking right, cuz I missed a lot
I was nineteen when they knocked me pop
And you expect me to not sling?
Seeing all these bitch niggas frontin
Knowin they ain't been threw it or did nothin

[Blitz]
I see your vision, but still can't understand how you livin
As if you never took a journey from prison, open your eyes

[Lake]
They are, and for you I see nothin happened
You rappin to yourself still walking from Queens Plaza

[Blitz] (Lake)
Yeah but I'm still me, nigga still G
And while, you behind the wall I'll be still free
You wilin' on these streets son (I don't care)
I see you headed back up north (But you ain't headed no where)

[Blitz]	When you trapped between right or wrong
	Do you fold or move right along?
	Make a decision quick, shit is thick
[Lake]	When you trapped between right or wrong
	Do you fold or move right along?
	Make a decision quick, shit is thick
[Blitz]	When you trapped between right or wrong
	Do you fold or move right along?
	Make a decision quick, shit is thick
[Lake]	When you trapped between right or wrong
	Do you fold or move right along?
	Make a decision quick, shit is thick
[Blitz]	When you trapped between right or wrong
	Do you fold or move right along?
	Make a decision quick, shit is thick

Lights, camera, action, tonight gon' be a movie
I just ordered 50 bottles of Ciroc, Rose and Goose
I got bad women everywhere, at least three of 'em choosin'
Red bottoms on the sofas up in VIP, sue me
For bein' young and reckless, wild and imperfectious
Blew a hundred hundred on a stripper then finesse her
I don't give a... see I'm just doin' what I want
See I'm young and I got money, light it up just like a blunt
Haters on the sideline, I don't really care
Stackin' money to the ceilin', yeah we ballin' everywhere

You take on face value how fast the light travel
It's seven cent gift from the Universe
Blessings, tired of Offerings
There's no compromisin' the truth
It might blow the roof off
Exposin' the Germ, take Worm
Poison animal eaters you must learn
Let me teach you how to see through six
Risin' above the mist, the naked eye can hardly detect
When I'm in effect, live and direct
It's the East New York section of Brooklyn
Bangin' ass beat make you wanna free techniques
We spray the Arts sword swingin' piss in the Heart
Sharp as a nigga on Prom Night
We strike wit a Vengeance
Givin' y'all the maximum sentence
Each sentence is like a time line for you to define
How to rhyme coincide and relate, to my last take
'No Said Date', say it loud 'Yo I'm Black and Proud'
The Cracker fuckin' backin' for any form of disrespect
To my Nations -- Seasonry and paper chasin'
For the God to agree
Guarantee to disassemble any MC stepin' in the place to be
Off the head I wrote this one in Red
For the Blood of all my people that said it
For the Cause, our Microphone ripped so swift

This first MC Law he swore to make the crowd raw
Came up through the floor drew his Mic from his hip and began
To squeeze Clip, son said 'Don't kill 'em as quick'
Let 'em do tray, palm stay 18 Jay
Who made it possible for you to witness?
First born built the weather to storm
Bees swarm like hundred witness scorn
This is warnin' to the people we sip in sour
Breezin' through the Caroline distribution
Pipe line spark it equal
Guarded people as divine makes it's final descent
To the Pavement, who laced it?, keepin' it basic
Who is this Ivory Jamel Ring Bells through out the city?
A few know him well this description Black Male
Wit the Universe who flag drippin' off as the Bell

Yo, we moving faster than the dukes of hazard
Play you like shoots and ladders
Don't have to shoot a bastard, I'm a super rapper
My single bound of leap is twelve inches
Eff a tall edifice
My evidence equivalent to Everest
Nevertheless I attack ya chest
Like a cardiac arrest
Snatch a sack of ses
Let's see who rap the best
You couldn't pass a test
You artificially intelligent
I read fake rappers like New Testaments
And King James versions
Rhymes operate like brain surgeons
Never been fucked with, remain virgin
It's a miracle, every time I work the mic
I deliver verses like, Mary giving birth to Christ
Serpents in paradise entice emcees
To bite my steez like apple trees
But actually that'd be a catastrophe
When the mic is passed to me
You'd rather feel the wrath of G-O-D
You know the score you was told before
Hold the mic like I hold a sword
Life is like the Trojan War
And I'm the one man army jumping out of horses
'Till the end of time, literary military forces

[Kodak]
Persistent paddling could be damaging to the average man

Resistance vanishing with no Anacin
Pulsating performance releasing any season 
My reason for being like a leaky faucet known to
trickle slow
Two triple O
Mastering magical moments when I get with Lo
Destined to blow 
See before I chose this path
Floated down rivers running fast avoiding riff raff
Ran into Heathcliff he told me "Get cash"
I laughed 'cause he was drowning
Sounding like he had a cold and stuff
Told him he can't control the stuff
They know to bust
This ain't no unsolved mystery, involves history
Dissolves chemically, revolves eventually
Witness seen it can't acquire fitness being bulimic
Extreme with skills to back the team with
My gems encompass
Purposely protected potently infected
Taken out of natural form, that's what I'm left with
Possess the seven habits of highly effective people
Bless the addicts with caffeine equal match my steeple
Cunning how a stunning child, lyrically endowed 
Could somehow stay on course running wild

[Illite]
Ayo you out of your league, rocking with me
And obviously I leave spots damaged my advantages
Leave niggas in bandages
Wrapped with very little breathing room
My thinking tool is equal to none 
See what you done?
You got me expanding my fist to slap you straight
Cause niggas be switching sides like tassels after you graduate

I'll knock your style off it's pedestal now
You hanging from my testicles now
And your fellas ain't nowhere to be found
Illite brings the raw with him
I had a fist full of marbles and lost 'em
I walk up in your fortress with a cordless and it gets way deeper

I'm trying to ignite mics in bright lights
And move crowds like motivational speakers
I take rhythms and turn 'em into wavelengths
Kidnap a couple of aliens to hot-wire their spaceships
So much inside, it's hard not to get my tongue tied up
That's why every time I finish a verse off a star lights up

*Scratches*

Senim Silla: (Ran with dogs that's rabid, rivers is rapid)

[Magestik Legend]
Try to keep it still it might hurt to listen
I grip this mic tight enough to make my elbows bust
through my shirt stitching

Y'all piss me off like I'm sick of working
You got me ready to wait near your car with a knife in
the night lurking

Like "give me that!"
Got me hanging up the phone like "man hit me back"
When I'm trying to write to spit these raps
Cause you don't understand what it take to write shit
to survive with

I write bullets to take lives with
Hop out the burning bush spitting live shit "Man!"
I'm trying to make some points that y'all can ride with
With ridiculous Speed like Nicholas be
Keep riding till your rims is ripping the street if you're feeling me

Cause easily I can be on some ol' Razor Ramón type tone
With styles free like Elzhee
So if you ain't hearing me bring it to me first
So wiping creatures off of the earth like G-O-D, Father part three
Perfect the way you deliver
You launching missiles them joints is skipping on the rivers

Running wild be like, when the crowd be hype
And we ain't got to deal with no lousy mics!

The Chinese have a saying; "Dangerous men will meet in narrow streets"

And that meant pressure on me, to make more weapons

Strangers suddenly appeared in Jungle Village

Aiyo, aiyo, machete's still stainless, the archbishop run from the narcs
A crisp biscuit, plus play the heart, wrist glisten
Cool captain, catch me in Africa, blacked down
With four, five Somalians, black Timbs
Rubber suit Wonder Woman, bangles and blue Coupe
I'm usually up on the roof, counting mad loot
Root beer reefer, T-frame, doing my one-two
Smoking with a plain Jane trooper
Excellent with rifles, out in Japan, in a flight goose
Switchblade that poke out the night boost
Flustered on the bullet train with chains on
Getting my train on, thunder money make bread brainstorm
All this is made for the Forbes list, whores get pissed
Aiyo, he fucked me out his drawers, he dissed me
All this is calculated, the Batman of the Blackhand
Mafia money, killas who rock tans

[Chorus 2X: U-God]
Bone, crushing, smooth, kicks
Blades, chopping, through, bricks
Master of the weaponry, sells to both clicks
Blacksmith, with the Iron Fists

[Ghostface Killah]
Yeah, yo, rigamortis, I watch your body rot to the bone structure
Scrape out your brain watch your eyeballs rupture
Black magic, leave your fucking skull in a soup pot
Makaveli, vamoose like 2Pac
Suicidal tendencies, downing white Hennessey
Look in the book, I'm the definition of menace, B
Choking niggas out for no reason, it's Duck Seazon
I'm cold as ice, six degrees below freezing
Stay dipped, rock a striped shirt like Freddy Krueger
You'se a baby piranha surrounded by barracudas
Seven thirty, I'm more like six o'clock
Straight up and down, beating niggas til there's blood in the socks
Ox' and duff 'em, stuff 'em in black bags
Without getting no blood on my fresh rags
Ruthless, heart of a stone, born with no emotions
I piss out brouhahas, poisonous potions

[Chorus 2X]

[Kool G. Rap]
Yeah, it's the three deadly venoms, with weapons in the denims
Some shit that'll shake windows and break late tenants
Come left field, aim crooked, and just straight blaze in 'em
Have you niggas with straight legs, with a fake leg in 'em
Wolf in sheep's clothing, nah, I'm scoping a tender lamb
Spin you bitches like a ballroom dinner dance
G mode, dress code, got suspended plans
Russian roulette, money bet, go and spend your chance
You little fleas, the Killa Beez and army ants
EMS cut up your jeans like zombie pants
Hollow chrome to your collar bone, pinned against a dope beat
That sound like the first key on the xylophone
Grown men discussing death in the mildest tone
See how quick the smiley faces turn solid stone
Ghostface, Rae and G be the wildest known
We straight street, but we keep a seat in the palace throne

[Chorus 2X]

Song:   Roll Wit Tha Flava
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

Verse One: Treach

Once again, it's on
where I'm from there aint no picket fences pick it
Straight and ruff so you pick it my sticky finger was a glock 
Many dash for the fast cash, but I like the cash to last
So I rap till my ass collapse
I'm never trouble but if troops will come and jam me 
You Remind Me like Mary then I'm scaring your little projects
On the prarie I'm hairy and hot like Dougie with a smokie
So I boo-boo, just like Fu-Schnicks I'll say F-U-2

Verse Two: Chip-Fu

A-bibbedy-bibbedy-bibbedy-bibbedy-bong-gang ultra-king
But BBD boxing up yang, giddy-up
Didduh-duh, didduh-duh, didduh-dum dum dum
I'm coming again and again a Ku-Fu vomit
Gosh, darn it!  Like we're lyin' to bits
The John-John Jacob lyrical shaker
Yes and Jengle-ma-heimershmitz
I sings my lyrical style from Flatbush
Quick to Greenwich Village
I'm strong to the finish
When I eats, me spinach
I'm one of the lyrical flava
My nigga Foxx is stompin faggots
Check my dum-dum-dum-dum-dum and step

Verse Three: Freddie Foxx

Now I been breakin rappers down for a while now
Now it's time to break, child
Rappers get chopped like the head on a fat cow
I'm mister micraphone, rappers can't fuck around
I'm Freddie the Foxx I'll brake it back and buck em buck em down
You know my rep I got a record like the turnpikes
When I was young they use to call me Freddie-burn-mics
But now they call me big Foxx, daddy boot-knocks
With burn marks on my hips from my twin glocks

Chorus

(Queen Latifah) I got flava for days   \
(KRS-One) Flava unit has a title          Repeats four times
Roll With the Flava                    /

Verse Four: Queen Latifah

Now it's about the time to put you out of sight and out of mind
I got the skills to blast you off the mic and out of rhymes
Now who the hell-am-I-a?
The L-A-T-I-F-A-H the motherfuckin sire
I come in on time
You wear a silly grin we like we do when niggaz in
We gotta practice so scalp the hairs off your chinny-chin-chin
The Flava Unit's got my back, so I'm quick to start shit
Get the short end of a bat, cause we beat him broken sticks

Verse Five: Heavy D

I-guy-guy-guy-guy-guy bet you never knew
That I could flow I flew I grow I grew
I blew up the spot, I'm sippin my props
And now I am just passin through
Ruff rugged rigid nigga, the one who's quick to figure
Some think they're big, but the heavster is bigger
The funky flip-flop flava unit, my hip-hop neigbor doin it
Came to the studio, check my flow, and ran right through it
I bet you thought I wouldn't come, I came
I'm never done till I'm done rippin drums like a shotgun, ohh!

Chorus

Verse Six: D-Nice

Now ladies, what's my name? (aaah)
That means it's time to go
I'm the same muuuhfucker from it's time to flow, so
Some might have dissed the way I flow it out
Niggaz need to throw it out
Simply cause it's somethin you don't know about
So watch the Nice man shake the ground
And now I'm Rollin with the Flava cause
The Flava's what I'm rollin in my sound
To make you get down, rippin the sound from J.C. to Uptown
Now

Verse Seven: Dres

Now if you got a nine, and you got a nine
And you got a nine, and you got a nine
And he got a nine, and she got a nine
Well it's a motherflockin party yo cause I got mine
So bust it the Black Sheep are (where?) here (where)
Here (where) there, everywhere there's a Jeep
There's a Sheep beat beatin up the air
Graphic as illustratin frustratin like waitin
The Sheep are a joke?  Nigga you playin
Yo I drink twenty forties, smoke forty blunts
Say a hundred rhymes and not sound like you once
Twice, three times, nigga never figured
You'd be triggered by Dres, that R and B smokin nigga
Doin it, screwin it, chewin it, well
Done on the weak bun hon can't you tell
Unification cells on the flava flingin
If a Queen has the balls my lady is a King
So long live the King, and love to my Unit
Spoon it and you'll croon it, diss it, and yo balloon it

Song:   Roll Wit' Us
Typed by: davpaul@dove.net.au

Throughout the cold nights we be cashin in
Makin dollars, makin shit pop around here
Fiends, niggas and cops and gangbangers rule my block
My everyday life is crime, a 9-to-5 of slangin rocks
9 millimetres, .3-80's, AK's and Glocks
Clockin major knots, I sit back and I watch it clock
Watchin in anybody and any, wit every fuckin dime, every penny
What a pity how we live in the city
livin greedy, livin selfish, rebellious witta spirit that is jealous
Developed the knack to kill and slang crack, huh
Smokin buddha's at a bomb orange buddha
Stabbin motherfuckers in the back in if they do ya
Roll wit niggas that's the same, roll around witta gang
Rollin to school my bang, bang, hang out
I'm sellin dope to strung-out fiends who always kept green
What's the American Dream? Makin makin money
keepin pistols and shit, cos ain't a damn thing funny
Niggas around my block be actin so crummy
Wit a little doe I maintain G's, status just to have it
Anything that I see it was my job just to have it
Sweepin down and sellin, where my homeboys live
Scoop 6-400, of that bomb smoked ass real
High, I can see the homeys pass by
We creep inside, lettin niggas know this Eastside

Now all my motherfuckin niggas they - ROLL WIT' US
And all my No Limit soldiers they - ROLL WIT' US
And all my Westside Connection niggas yo they - ROLL WIT' US
And all my Dogg Pound, niggas they - ROLL WIT' US
And all my niggas from Death Row - ROLL WIT' US
And all my Outlaw niggas they - ROLL WIT' US
And everybody round the neighbourhood - ROLL WIT' US
Say they ROLL WIT' US, I said they ROLL WIT' US

In the city it was about wreck
Where I stay the 'fluence is pursuin the life of a G
Totin weapons was my profession, my moms catch me
She beat me but it ain't teachin me no lessons of survivin
Diamonds investin, cars that's impressive
I'm slangin now, major 'caine now
Quarter P's and half pounds and whole pounds, ugh
All my life all I heard was gun sound
Age 13 I joined a major gang in Sittown
I got the hood tatted for life, anybody cross me
I will pay dearly from gun blastin, blood on the knife
To be a motherfuckin gangsta was all I wanted
Daz Dillinger out to amke out wit a million dollars
Shot caught him plus ballin, I'm 17
In the hood, straight love me from them Gz to them fiends, huh
Small timin to big ballin
I moved up from some small shit to packin full clips
And everybody knew me all around the town
I'm layin punk motherfuckers down

Now all my niggas in Texas they - ROLL WIT' US
And all my niggas from Oklahoma they - ROLL WIT' US
All my niggas from Louisiana - ROLL WIT' US
And all my Bay Area niggas yo they - ROLL WIT' US
All my niggas in Chicago they - ROLL WIT' US
All my niggas in Seattle yo they - ROLL WIT' US
Everybody round the neighbourhood - ROLL WIT' US
Say they ROLL WIT' US, say they ROLL WIT' US

Get out the way if you ain't about paper, bustin on player haters
who think they can fade us, that's how the streets made us
Invincible, leavin the whole scene critical
Takin over your shit man that's the main principle
Here we go, here we are, niggas roll around in fancy cars
Fuckin rap stars, sellin weed and caviar
You think ya wasn't serious til y'all got blasted
Rollin wit them sucker ducks'll leave you in a casket
It's drastic to suicide, how we ride?
Jump out on yo ass within the blink of an eye
Cash money got me addicted, til worry niggas kick it
Good shit from bad shit, that's how we get Pacific
The G is for give me, the A is for anybody killin in this
for the niggas plus the G's we be gettin

All my motherfuckin niggas they - ROLL WIT' US
All my niggas from Long Beach - ROLL WIT' US
All my niggas from Compton - ROLL WIT' US

[Chorus: Armel]
There comes a time when you know, brothers careers must come to an end
We usually spit for ya'll, but today we came for the heads of men, so
Hip hop must reknew it's history, so the music can last forever
Ya'll either roll with us, or make sure you got your shit together

[Armel]
Surprise, see me face, who you?
Threw a hex over the crowd like it's voodoo
You know a stool in the pot, hooked it up, hot
A little blessings are added from Cory and Got
My flow, lyrical, swag, I'm hotter
Looking for a group that can rhyme, I gotcha
First in our bracket, the group is Yellow Jackets
If it didn't add up, it wouldn't be mathematics

[General Jihad]
Good riddance, Afro clown, MC's be spitting
Adjust your ears to the sounds of true and living
Gold all in diamonds, stand pivotal position
If it's competition, only find yourself in submission
A-L-L-A-H, we represent the west, hey
Stand tall like skyscrapes from the west to the Tri-State
Yeah, it's our weight, watch the Gods demonstrate
Congregate and bring forth the force of earthquakes

[Skratch]
The gully niggas getting sliced up in the tummy quick
My game go, like my bankroll when my money flip
King step up out the paint, not on that funny shit
I'm thankful when I can make moves, I'm hungry, bitch
Yeah, and how the boy has grown so
Stand on my hands and walking through the dojo
Picture perfect, go 'head and cop a frame for it
Listen to that bullshit, I ain't the player for it

[Chorus]

[Ram]
My sword hard but we graceful
Walk without fear and intimidate the hateful, erase fools
Put 'em on the shit list, unleash the beast
And make 'em shit, when I get pissed, smash 'em with the quickness
Powerful prodigies, breeded from how I birth
Children of the sun, any one of us can be the one
I swing swords with the power of Conan
And Samson, blood of us who the warriors, Ram, son

[Shaddow]
Ugh, and I'm ready for raw battle
Slaughter MC's by the herd like farm cattle
Stay out the shadows, I'm sending the Swarm at you
Some Wu-Tang wasps they call the Yellow Jackets
Let's get it cracking like a helmet when you line it back
I can put a metal to your chest like you wire taped
So get the message you can roll or get stepped on
You only hating us, cuz you know we the best off, for real

[Surpreme]
Surpreme I Self, the truth sayer
I dive into your thoughts, manifest like a prayer
Snatch the air, out of your chest cavity
My mind define laws, unbound by gravity
It's that Wu-Tang West, I'm where the sun sets
Let the knowledge be born, Yellow Jackets form the Swarm
Ya'll niggas get the flesh torn straight off of your frame
My tongue razor sharp, beat cuts slicing your brain, now that's game

Typed by: jostmatt@bluewin.ch

Yo
Y'all
Y'all!
Drop that, man

Yeah
On a gangsta tip
Freddie Foxxx in the house 
You know what I'm sayin?
Rollin with the Flava
We gon' set it off like this
Check it out

On the one...

Let me hear you say 
Go Fox-o, go Fox-o go
(Go Fox-o, go Fox-o go)
Yo, let me hear you say 
Go Fox-o, go Fox-o go, come on
(Go Fox-o, go Fox-o go)

(Get on the mic and get rough)  --> KRS-One

[ VERSE 1 ]
I'm back again to wreck mics and threat the mic-holder
I'm still hardcore gettin mines, like I told ya
I still keep a gun on my waistline, clip in a fat rhyme
Shoot you in the chest with the tec, in the head with the nine
You rappers can't swing the Freddie Foxxx style
Man, I make the softest nigga think he's buckwild
I never won a Grammy, never made a hit
But everytime a rapper get on stage with Freddie Foxxx, he get his ass whipped
I break em down daily
My voice so ill, I make Barry White sound like Philip Bailey
You rappers don't faze me with the rough talk 
Boy, you better back up and pack up 
Before I load the mack up
I swing with the mic, and zhigge-zhigge-zhig it right
And beat you rappers down that just can't speak it right
I been a ruffneck since I was a baby, ask my mama
When I got out, it was just for bringin niggas drama
So set up the beef, I bust it down
And guarantee the opposition never see the 2nd round
And by the end of the song, you're in a trap
Screamin in the crowd, "Freddie Foxxx, bust a rap!"

(Rough)

(Get on the mic and get rough)

[ VERSE 2 ]
A lotta rappers try to front like they're rougher than they really are
But you're just a booty-ass nigga with a nice car
I bet the girls just like you cause they seen you on the video
You wanna meet a real live nigga, here we go, hoe
First I teach you not to talk back, teach you to be loyal
Show her that my gangsta style's above royal
Teach her bout the murder game, so she'll never hate it
Then hit her with a .380 snub-nose nickel plated
See, ladies know the only thing that I like is my gun and my mic
A piece of ass, and a good fight
I'm still knockin niggas out, ain't nothin changed, gee
My bodyguards hold me back when there's beef
So understand the Militant Mack will never switch up
A lotta y'all talk behind my back, but in my face y'all bitch up
Yo baby boy, hold me down
While I go inside a sucker nigga's house and bust a couple of rounds
It's like the nigga in white that'll blast you in daylight
And stand there till the cops come and fight
And even if they lock me in jail, I be aight
I do a lotta push-up's, and kill a lotta mice in the night
But once they let me go 
You suckers better know 
I hit my stash
Then I'm comin for that ass

Yeah
Flippin it on the one
For the Flavor
We gon' set it off hardcore like this
Let me hear you say 
Rip it Fox-o, rip it Fox-o rip it
(Rip it Fox-o, rip Fox-o rip it)
Yo, let me hear you say 
Rip it Fox-o, rip it Fox-o rip it, come on
(Rip it Fox-o, rip Fox-o rip it)
Let me hear you say
Break, Fox-o, break Fox-o break
(Break Fox-o, break Fox-o break)

(Get on the mic and get rough)

[ VERSE 3 ]
I like to cruise through Brooklyn in my old Buick Regal
And right on my left my .45 Desert Eagle
Say what's up to my boys still rappin on the corner
They want me to hang, but I'm solo, I don't wanna
Check it, I knock boots like a superstar 
Girls know who they are
My name ain't Bobby Brown 
Girl, I'm humpin around
So you see Freddie Foxxx, girl, you wanna get laid
My name ain't Aaron Hall, girl, you better be afraid
I jump inside your ass like I was Johnny Meat
And do the Sweet-Dick-Willie to a fat beat
I hump you gangster style, and turn you out 
Went through all the positions that the girls love to talk about
I have you strung out, hopin that we blow up
Waitin for me all day, but I never show up
Because the mic is my first love, it'd never leave
I stick a mic in a rapper's ass and make him bleed
I'm Mr. Nice Lyrical Style, Freddie Foxxx, did it
Stamina Daddy, freak the funk, girl, don't forget it
So next time you see me killin on the ave., baby
With a hoodie and a .45 mag, baby
Don't play me close, cause it's beef and I'm on a mission
I'm huntin down the fox, so baby listen

Yeah, you know the flavor, baby
And before we slide
We gon' do it on the ill, knowmsayin?
One for the road, and we gon' set it off like this
On the one
Check this out

Let me hear you say 
Go Fox-o, go Fox-o go

"Lyrical terrorists"


[Iriscience]
I bring High-towers like Ron
til my powers are drawn
then let raw surges like cubes of Energon
Which Judas emcee ??? double-cross like Exxon
I put a hex on, science needed to catch wrecks gone
The mic's a wand so when I rap you see stars
Kicking lines in your face that'll make you see bars
incarcerated, increasin' heart rate like a novice
gettin' faded and today's your start date
The stage is getting flooded and your ass is shark bait
cuz you're bleeding
You are transmitting but I'm not receiving
I used to be in 3D now I'm 4D like ?fairlane?
Iristyle be high and pressurized like an airplane
Trained I'm precise to make the crowd tingle
You finally get to kick it and miss like Ray Finkle
All righty then, spin emcees like frisbees
and got verbal animation on lock like Walt Disney

"The ruggedness, the ruggedness" (8X)

[Evidence]
Yo, my rhymes are always up to par with the chorus
Chop rappers down like trees in the rain forest
If hip-hop was baseball I'd win the Cy Young
for throwing raps more harder than pitches by Nolan Ryan
Right down the center I enter like The Dragon
with fire in my eyes watch the thermometer rise
Intellectual battle rhymer in cadence to the millisecond
in consecutive(s) victories with ease (back to back)

[Iriscience]
Hey, you aint Ultramag - seckle with the Ego Trippin'
and you aint De La - seckle with the Ego Trippin' Two (too)
Dilated People ripping crew kids students that are truant
I get up in minds like Xavier's in mutants
While you should get smart about chaos and *control*
your style is *old* with no *soul* like Bob *Dole*
Even seeming simpletons like Clinton are rhoades scholars
My style is seldom seen like the ??? on the ???

[Evidence]
Yes,
I swarm like insects, I get wreck when in sex
My rhymes shine like windex
from index to-uh glossary (glossary)
front to back cover to cover
When the snare cracks over the phat track, I hover
on hydroplane like tires on ice
Yo I break it down to the raw elements like rice
My 4-4 hits lethal to your jaw, without one flaw
I represent ????? like ?????
I roll like Nyquil put heads to bed (good night)
No lead, straight up gems in my toolshed (thats right)
I grab a few and a couple more for backup
some slow raps for new jacks for when they speed the track up
Don't let me pull the pin at the sport your in
you better play the opposite of a terrapin
The air we in's too thin for the both of us to win
You test me the in the day and then I eat you up for dinner
Ruggedness

<indistinct> <conjunction with hook>
Yes
Dilated, Dilated
nothing less
Dilated, Dilated
yes, yes
soulbrothers, mad sweet
yes, yes

One time, one time nigga one time! (Where?)

Runnin' from the police (Yeah I know what you mean)
No matter what I do, they got a nigga
still runnin' from the police
(Put them motherfuckin Nike's on tight and get ghost y'all)

[Dramacydal]
I ain't got nuttin on my mind, but gettin in some trouble
Lickin shots to they block leavin bloody blood puddles
for some ridah delight, now we in a gunfight
I can shoot the gauge pebbles at the devils or die tonight
It's on me, but if I die bury me a motherfuckin G
A open casket on them bastards so they all remember me
With my vest on my chest, my tools and my piece
Thug Life motherfucker gotta me runnin' from the police

Nigga, you know that's true
Catch a nigga like K-Dog, chillin wit a crew
Every damn day parlay with my glass of Re
The O.J. and it's all OK
'til that fuckin fake cop got to play the man
Ran me down the block with my glass in my hand
Damn, I hope it don't spill
Nigga chill, shit is real cock back my steel

Still runnin' from the police I gets no sleep
I got you peepin in my window while I'm smokin indo
But I ain't no motherfuckin track star, pig's got a Jeep
like Big Mouth, runnin through motherfucker's backyards
So I, grabs my piece before I flee
And instead of me runnin', these bitches is runnin' from me
Lick shots hits spots off on my piece
Cause a nigga like Big Mouth is through runnin' from the police

[Interlude: Buju Banton]
I bust off!  What about the time they pull me from the Bronco
lay, they tried to cock me, but them can't gun store
When a batty bwoy do it from the mob
Ahh, pull up your pants then you screw an left squad
Look around, look around, punk police
While gwan man doesn't a come but a bad boy test
Look around, look around, punk police
Me hafta blast back, cause de blast is best

[Stretch]
Yo I was, schemin and fiendin for loots and took the crooked route
to, ghetto fame I felt the pains and now I run the game
The insane brain, cold gettin fly like a plane

[Notorious B.I.G.]
Check it, I grew up a fuckin screw-up
Got introduced to the game, got a ounce and fuckin blew up
Choppin rocks overnight
The nigga Biggie Smalls tryin to turn into the black Frank White

[Stretch]
And we got the workers choppin rock, Benz by the flock
And we gettin it, the dirty cops are jealous so they sweatin it
I'm lettin off smoke, hope they don't play me for no joke
and provoke the homicide, so just let the drama slide
We keepin it real, fuck how you feel, Biggie pass the steel
Let's serve these motherfuckers slugs as a fuckin meal

[Notorious B.I.G.]
We had to grow dreads to change our description
Two cops is on the milk box missin
Show they toes you know they got stepped on
A fist full of bullets a chest full of Teflon
Run from the police picture that, nigga I'm too fat
I fuck around and catch a asthma attack (*heavy breathing*)
That's why I bust back, it don't phase me
When he drop, take his glock, and I'm Swayze
Celebrate my escape, sold the glock, bought some weight
Laid back, I got some money to make, motherfucker

[Interlude: Buju Banton]
Now it's war, me tryin to sell, runnin from the punk po-lice
They try to cock me, but them can't gun store
What about they come to hold up me North
Pulled up the park, I left school and left buck
Look around, look around, punk police
Was about to blast with ya gun but you can't stop me
Look around, look around, punk police
Me haf to blast back, cause blast back best

[2Pac]
They got me runnin' from the five-oh
duckin and dodgin in my survival
The Benzo and I let off with my nine, hoe
I'm movin swifter than the next nigga, no time for sex
Cause in my mind all I wonder is who's next
Nigga, my homey slipped and now he pays the price
He did a driveby, sixteen, now he's doin triple life
Tell me is it me or my upbringin, I spit that thug shit
Nigga motherfuck singin, I hope you got your Timberlands
on tight, cause I ain't givin up
I'd rather duck these motherfuckers all night
I'm runnin' through the projects, beyotch
They'll never catch me
Cause I'm loc'd and trigger happy on the, sneotch
Don't say you never heard of me, til they murder me, I'm a legend
Do Thug Niggas go to heaven?
I'm rollin with the thorough heads
We gettin ghost on them hoes and yo
I got no love for the five-oh I'm runnin' from the police

[Wale]
Ay, look, yeah
Where did my time go? I let it fly
Spending time trya find em and y'all niggas the right flow
I like hoes that like poles in clean clubs
My slight fo's just talk dirty, I clean em up
Money I make em buck, trust they seen enough
Lust will have you slippin', love will have you stuck
From where they praise, bitches is artificially duck
Politicians be stuntin' most of them niggas dumb
Roll a swisher lets move it, my position improving
Not to mention I adventured into a cooler unit
Moving in unison used to be such a hooligan
But now I'm on a roll, I think I'm Patches O'Houlihan
Ben Stiller, Zoolander, same face
Bars change a nigga life, nigga scared straight
Jordan 8 strapped up, blasting out some backyard
Backwoods in my ashtray, I'm happier when high and drunk
Baby I'm in the zone, lately been writing poems
Can't put my soul in this bullshit music that y'all condone
Motherfuck It, I'mma count all these duckets
I'ma keep my integrity, y'all can keep all y'all budgets
Buzz it, like my very first day in here
Laying here, laying here, all in your lady ear
Mercedes rear view, that's where today appears
I'm past present, you light-years behind here
Wale

[Chorus: Teedra Moses]
Rolling while I'm blowing this stash
Got my foot on the gas, drop top on this thang
And the moon looking beautiful as ever
See these lights got me on another level
Feeling like tonight
We're running wild tonight
They can never hold, me, down
Cause I'm running - gone

[Meek Mill]
Uh, uh, yeah
They Larry Davis me and said I tried to kill a cop
Picture that and they ain't fire not a single shot
They said I'm guilty, I ain't get the chance to say im not
Bail was a quarter mill, they put me in a box
Ha, dead broke tryna get a bail
Calling niggas really knowing they dont give a hell
But I ain't give a fuck cus I ain't trying sit in jail
They giving niggas letters here and they ain't sending mail
I'm talking life sentence, forever night spending
This shit right here will turn a man to a mice, nigga
This shit right here will turn a killer to a nice nigga
Cold cell, lock down like a vice gripper
Lead by my strategy, winning I do sporadically
Try attacking me, automatic shoot automatically
City backing me, headed for it, no looking back at me
Lyrical assult, they charge me without the battery
Ha, Running rebel on another level
Like the Olympics these youngins just won another metal
They say to get a hundred mill you must become the devil
If you believe that, nigga you is dumb as ever
Young and dumb, or even old and stupid
I put my faith in God, never try I just do it
Niggas get down for the moment, they ain't for movement
My nigga Rozay put me on the tour cause I am music

[Chorus]

[Stalley]
I ainâ€™t never been a dreamer or fascinated by a Beamer
Or none of those funny floats niggas gloat in
I keep it classic in that metal frame box I smoke in
Then push the milk on a slow bend
Wit my kin that I came in with
Blue Collar Gang, we slang that ish
The script stuck to it, hustle like we ain't gain ish
Never lookin for a handout, ain't my language
I work hard for everything I get and keep a tight grip for everyone
Waiting on the day I slay, a rebel though
I don't hold my lips; they say I talk 
like I'm God body, Bob Marley, Marvin and Marcus
And since I skipped over puddles they try to throw me where sharks is
But I'm a well of inspiration
A wishing well they throw they chips to in desperation
All bets on em, double MG tell my foes I ain't left on em

Straight West Coast mutherfuckin' G's

I rock the rolo back ended down
I broke it low, you wet it down
When I rip up in a bulletproof 600 
Niggas I just have to turn it down
I came for the chips
Don't worry I'll rain with a hollow tip
I drop the game with the kicks
And run the soul train line on you bitch
I got the
Game with this I make the 56th sense
And trick
It's gon' take more than a motherfucker playing up with this
And if you ain't buying you dying
Hollow tips flying make you deceased
I'll ride on you bitch ass niggas who won't let Makeveli Rest In Peace {echo}
  
Hook (x2)
  
[C-Bo]
When a guy gets dug deep
Gon' scrub that ass like Rub deep
Gets no love for me, so I took your 100G's but was scared to plug me
You've been bitin since Wetcoast Bad Boys
Now you're bitin Makeveli
With his name and game, you get the fame and chain
Tell me what's next
It seems funny not even Cash Money fuck wit you dummy's
Came out the closet like Mummy's
Bitin' everything in sight, still you're hungry
They say you boys let Pac live
Soon as it drop you copy his spirit
Feel the rippled in the water nigga
That's more than 5 a note
That's what I'm ridin' for!
  
Hook (x2)

Learn the game before you get disrespect again
I'm talkin' to that East Coast ass nigga Memphis Bleek (motherfucker)
Already stolen grounds, on the radio station talkin' shit slidin'
I'm gon' do it for my nigga Charlie Hustle cause I'm West Side Ridin'!

{*gun is cocked and fired*}

(I'm King News and I come to you with the truth
The mean streets took six more lives overnight
all the result of gang-bang stupidity
By the way, you gangsters should know
one of your victims was a three year old girl
Well, you gang members, you still don't get it, do ya?)

(With your badself)

[King Tee]
It's straight up madness everywhere I look
Used to be a straight a student, now he's a crook
Robbin people just to smoke or shoot up
Used to have a crew cut, now he's a pooh-put
Dropped out of school and he joins the neighborhood gang
Hangin on the streets sellin caine
To his own people
Now when I say people I mean color
You a stupid muthaf...
I'm tryin to stress the fact that you're dumb
Get yourself presentable, son, and just come
Together, you better, cause pretty soon it's gonna be too late
A message from King Tee The Great

[Body & Soul]
Sisters, since we are the mothers of this earth
It's time we start being good mothers from the birth
Of our children, no time for sleepin
Teach em to fight and win for the right reason
It's your time, it's your life, live it
Proud to be black, young and gifted
Lifted by the knowledge and takin the right route
Gang violence needs to be wiped out
A-l-m-i-g-h-ty C and E-z-i-r-e
We see the f-u-t-u-r-e
Should be a positive thang
Body & Soul and you, we're in the same gang

[Def Jef]
One and the same
Everyone came in the same chains
Caught with the same aim
Brain games and names changed
To protect the innocent by-stander
Lies, slander and the master-planner
Destroy the black male
Crack jail and semi-automatic
For static if the crack fails
So since we all talk the same slang
Stop killin, my brother, cause we're all from the same gang

[Michel'le]
Don't you know we've got to put our heads together?
Make the change cause we're all in the same gang

[Tone-Loc]
Now as a youth I used to get my bang on
And on the ave get my part-time slang on
Upon a time for me was no joke though
They knew I was crazy, so they labelled me Loco
Khakis creased, golf hat, feelin sporty
Low ridin and tossin up a forty
Thinkin in my mind that no one could handle us
The downest brothers ever touched Los Angeles
I found life was much more suitable
Cause I'm the brother that makes black so beautiful
I ain't slippin or down with a head trip
I'm talkin to all the Bloods and all the Crips
Throw down your rag and get on the right track, man
It's time to fight, unite and be a black man
Tone-Loc is on a positive change
Cause remember, we're all in the same gang

[Above The Law]
Bein the pimps that we are
We're here to speak on a situation that has gone too far
Here at home in the ghettos of LA
Where a young black brother's not promised to see the next day
Cause we used to clock on the streets before we made beats
But fools just lay and prey on the weak
It don't depend on the color of a rag
Cause if you got what they want you know they gonna take what you have
Cause violence don't only revolve from drugs and thugs
And gangs that bang
Most times it's a political thang
Yeah, a couple of spots'll get popped
And if the government wanted to freeze it it could all get stopped
But they don't because they want it like that
Because the system been set up to hold us back
Yeah, Above The Law means that we can do whatever
So why don't we stick together?
(You got it)

[Ice-T]
Ice-T rippin the microphone the way I do
Listen close, my brothers, cause I'm talkin to you
The problem is we got a suicidal lifestyle
Cause 90 percent of us are livin foul and wild
I say job, you say ([Hen-G:] bad joke
I rather jack another brother, watch the gun smoke)
Livin in the fast lane flippin like you're insane
You won't stop until your blood runs down the street drain
I got an idea, give me a minute
And if it makes sense, then get with it
What if we could take our enemies, feed em poison
Undereducate their girls and boys and
Split em up, make em fight one another
Better yet, make em kill for a color
All my brothers need to know one thing
No matter what you think, we're all in the same gang

[Michel'le]
Don't you know we've got to put our heads together?
Stop the fighting
(Make the change)
Because we're all in the same gang

[Dr. Dre & MC Ren]
Yo, we're not here to preach because we're not ministers
We're tellin like it is cause Ren and Dre is like sinister
Reality speaks for itself when it's spoken
A basehead cluck can't blame nobody for smokin
Yo, bullets flyin, mothers cryin, brothers dyin
Lyin in the streets, that's why we're tryin
To stop it from fallin apart and goin to waste
And keepin a smile off a white face
N.W.A never preachin, just teachin
The knowledge of the streets to each and
All that don't understand, that's why we came
To let you know that we're all in the same gang

[JJ Fad]
The J double, F, the a, the d, that is
And if you want the solution to the quiz
What's black in black, yo, and kills another?
An ignorant sucker that isn't labelled as a brother
But another
So now it's time we evolve
And get together and solve it
Cause the world is revolvin
Around a terrible situation
One will kill another for a reputation
So it's time we stop and realize that we're all the same
Yo Dre, tell em (We're all in the same gang)

[Young MC]
Brothers killin other brothers
I thought the idea was to love one another?
Open up the paper to one more death
If y'all keep this up then there'll be no one left
I try my best to set an example
Sayin hype lyrics over hip-hop samples
Not just a bragger to boast but to inform
Cause we're livin in the calm before the storm
You see, I believe that the children are the future
But what's it all about if in the future they shoot ya?
We're all human beings, if we're cut we'll bleed
And I want to see all young people succeed
Do 9 to 5, not 5 to 10
Just go to work and not the state pen
Cause you live better when you're out there free
And that's comin straight to ya from the Young MC

[Digital Underground]
I'm in a rage
Oh yeah? Yo, why is that g?
Other races, they say we act like rats in a cage
I tried to argue, but check it, every night in the news
We prove them suckers right and I got the blues
America...
Get busy, Humpy
The red, the white, the blue and
The blue and the red
For Clips and Bloods
The white for who's got you doin
Time bustin caps on one another
The Underground's down for peace among brothers
Kill a black man?
What?
Yo, what are you retarded?
Tell em, Hump
Yo, do you work for the Klan?
Do what you like
Unless you like gangbangin
Let's see how many brothers leave us hangin

[Oaktown's 3.4.7.]
The gang that should hang is the one that contains
The sisters and the brothers who are all in the same frame of mind
Now listen, get loose, it's unity time
Yeah, yeah
Peace is a presence that we all need
The future's in our hands, in word and deed
I'm Terrible T and I'm Sweet LD
We're 3.5.7. totally

[MC Hammer]
Kickin on the ave 'bout a quarter to 9
All the homies gettin blind in an eight ball line
Now on this tip they started runnin at the lip
Jumped in their deuce and took a little trip
Hit the block about 12 on the tick
The windows went down and the nines went click
People started yellin, bodies started bailin
Bullets cold flyin sendin some to hell and
It's gotta stop, we don't need all the violence
Peace in the hood and a moment of silence
We got together not for ego or fame
We got involved cause we're all in the same gang

[Eazy-E]
Last but not least, yo, Eazy's no sell-out
And if you can't hang in the streets, then get the hell out
I'm not tryin to tell ya what to do
You have your own freedom of choice who to listen to
You knew good from bad, fair from foul, right from wrong
Now your mother's singing that sad song
(My baby ain't never hurt nobody!)
But he still got smoked at Bébé's party
But you're not the first or the last
You're nothin but a short story from the past
You're dead now, not number one but a zero
Take notes from Eazy-E, the violent hero

Typed by: Raneforezt@AOL.com

(Slug):
Sometimes I wonder if you'll ever shut the hell up
But you don't quit, and you just don't stop 
Sometimes Iwanna hop on the 5 and ride circles around my city a couple times
And pity my troubled life 
Sometimes I wake up like 'fuck the world!' 
And after I fuck my girl, I wanna curl up in the corner of my basement
Waitin' for civilization to fold
The pressure pays the toll, it takes control
So I can be a better dad, I can be better in bed
I can be a better man, I can be better off dead
I can a better son, boyfriend or employee
But I better fix my head before I let that shit destroy me
Yeah, you know me, that cat with no game, no gear
Been in love as many times as I've been alive in years
It ain't my fears that's riding me, nope
It's how I cope and construct, and how I act as if I don't give a fuck
But damn, if I stop and count the amount of fucks I've handed out
All in the name of trying to find what it's about
I'd probably drown, gasp, cough, gurgle, found dead
Stiff position as if I'm about to jump that hurdle
So while you lose your hair, I'm losing a war
You living thick off the pulp while I'm chewing the core
And sometimes I reflect, sit and wish that I was ignorant
Unaware of the poison so I could enjoy sipping it
That's why the only thing on my mind is everything
So I blame my brain for trying to hold me down
And when they finally wash it and hang it out to dry
Make sure they know I spoke, make sure they know my sound

(Eyedea):
Dear primate relatives with extra-terrestrial intelligence
I've gathered delicate information stating my spaceship's developed a virus
And I was thrown out of orbit past the moon
And crashed here November 9th, 1981, Monday afternoon
I've adapted to this twisted way of living
But I always knew I wasn't from this planet cuz I'm so damn different
I've kicked it with kids that would've but couldn't
Kids that could've but wouldn't
Some took it, misunderstood, stood under it and overlooked it
Love, hate, straight, crooked
Bad, good, should, shouldn't
Plastic, metal or wooden
It's all a part of water based pudding
This is a cry for help and I don't give a fuck
I've joined every alien cult on earth waiting for ya'll to pick me up
I've sipped the cup of reality, now my brain is dying
I try and explain I'm not human, now my room is an insane asylum
They blame the violence on children and try to forget they raised 'em
Jerry Springer and Banned From TV is what they get paid from
Man, I hate them homosapiens, they're a little too complex
Survival instincts are blocked for the biggest cock contest
Man, please come get me, the shit's sickening
Man, I can't stand it
I wanna break the ozone and go home to my own planet
This panic, I'm stranded, goddamnit I'm damaged, my sanity's bandaged
Ever since I landed I've been abandoned and planned to run
I ran and managed to reach peace for a day or two
But it's probably government computer chips that make me think the way I do
Hey, I knew my origin was beyond this galaxy, even as a baby
I asked the ones who told to call parents and they said I was crazy
I've been beat half to death by those designated to serve and protect
I pay them taxes from my check so they break my neck
Now take a sec and think what I did to deserve this
I'm waiting for the mothership spacecraft
To take me away from this purposeless earth shit
It's worthless
I'm like a polar bear living in the equator
Or an ice cube in the refrigerator
I'm outta place and outer space is where I need to get ya'll
So when you come down, just remember I'm leaving with ya'll
Sincerely yours truly, Eyedea  

Chorus:
So if you've got a savior, please won't you introduce?
Cuz you muthafuckas behavior has got me broken loose

(Sole):
Oh, ya don't like sand? I heard it tastes like dirt
I do dirt, my girlfriend used to be a rock
All the favorite words, they woulda been 'stop' if she could talk
So I did, lovemaking, playing inside a mole hill
Ever read the diary of the ego without a fate?
Music without a place
Man without a plate
Metal plate in skull which means I'll never get a chance to fly
Wasn't coordinated enough to get college grants for playing sports
But I stole your girl
She was lucky enough to get the goods by a smooth talkin', player hatin' 
On the class failin', shoplifting one man solar system
I'm the sun to earth, super nova Novocain, no preservatives
Don't know exactly what life means
But I know for damn well that she ain't talkin' to me
But I know everything I spend will somehow ends in negativity
I can smoke all your imbeselic isms and idol ideologies
For idiots who idolize ideals but never truly comprehend 
And feel experience experiments
They said take breaths when you can
I fill my pockets will small triangle remnants of static moments
Pessimism appeals to Sole which stikes him as more likable
Never know no equals, still my style becomes more biteable
I forgot how to sleep, don't remember being tired
Which means heads think I'm sick until the day that I'm fired
A wise man told me be a snake and let all people believe you're a sheep
Cuz all ya have is your pride, so in the end you'll never sell me cheap

[Intro]
Sharp Shooter regime, Godz Work regime
Baby J all the way, smooth as Alize
Yo, yo, General Grym, yo
lockin it down like the federal pen'
Yo, we gon' start wit the hook

[Chorus]
I'm 'bout to wreak havoc on the beast this year
Labels ain't tryin to promote this here
Commercial radio shows, they just don't care
The savior of the rap world now appears
To my peeps on the pavement, time is near
To my peers on my wavelength, have no fear
10 years of politicin make me aware
My soul is more precious than rap careers

[Verse 1]
I'm holdin lives, armies of God immobilized
Reclaimin scrolls, stolen by spies, holdin fives
My mother's swollen eyes prepare me for warfare
Bustin of clear in your ear, with more flair, than the 4th of July
My Sharp Shooter regime got the prototype to blow a mic
You couldn't see me in infrared photo light, I'm so precise
You know the Poet's nice, carryin tubes made of gold and ice
Marchin through your outpost, causin outbursts
Caught you in your house, cold made your mouth hurt
Just sayin my name is a federal offence
Now you fuckin with the hip-hop General, who's attacks in indefendable
Your weak spine is bendable, your weak my mind is pretend-a-bone
It wants to act sensible but lacks intelligence to pull it off
You only understand the bullet talk
Instead of talkin that bull, you shoul've walked out of my territory
My clever story severs cornies, by measures put together lyrically
You like a terror orgy, you rap niggaz ---- bore me
Made me into this sword carryin, caught buryin
Lord varyin, you know the Gods twist it like Bavarian pretzels
Plus, I'm never respectful, to those who are neglectful
of their duty to cilvilze, as they minimize the power of a live mic
See I maximize all cracks in their vibes, just to provide light
and only the strong survive, so I keep the rhyme tight

[Chorus]
I'm 'bout to wreak havoc on the beast this year
Labels ain't tryin to promote this here
Commercial radio shows, they just don't care
The savior of the rap world just appeared
To my peeps on the pavement, time is near
To my peers on my wavelength, have no fear
10 years of politicin make me aware
My soul is more precious than rap careers

[Verse 2]
Modern scientists clone cows and sheeps, just grown from cells
Manipulate nature where guns fail, war tactics vary
Our adversary has various ways to bury us ex-slaves
of America, every day could be your last day
You could be blasted the fast way, caps stray, then ricochet
and flash gray matter, while you prayin to the father
Kissin the coba, kids in the corner is turnin the streets into a suana
In the black home, while the black dome
lacks the backbone to recapture the black phone
You got arians all up in your face
and y'all buggin off who got the fuckin hottest mixtape
in New York state, war schemes, your plots, endorse feds
and plot lace the block with crates full of glocks
See, they got more fiends fiendin for morphines and more rocks
than Plymouth, until it's too hot for the timid street chemist
Got more bass then DJ's got bass-bins, jakes'll pull a raidin
Stomp at the cop in combat, mortals are charged like Rayden
You caught off guard, now armed guards excort you to court
offices where officers offer certain deals which appeal
to the snake mind, yo, it ain't hard to find from clothes designs
to jewels, to mixtapes to the way that niggaz rhyme
Yo, I'm fed up, me and the Gods, set up
So, every other fuckin team get wet up

[Chorus]
I'm 'bout to wreak havoc on the beast this year
Labels ain't tryin to promote this here
Commercial radio shows, they just don't care
The savior of the rap world just appeared
To my peeps on the pavement, time is near
To my peers on my wavelength, have no fear
10 years of politicin make me aware
My soul is more precious...

Album:  Next Chapter Compilation
Song:   Soul Searchin'
Typed by: nelly@itis.com

Intro:
Abouttohit you with some real shhhh. Smooth and Mykill
Western HemisFear style. Vooodu on the track uh.

Verse 1:
Deep in the canals of the heart where all problems start
Where niggas that's real show how they feel
On this Earth 20 some odd years
Through the blood sweat and tears and all of my fallen peers
Through the vilence and violence how can I live
Through all these drive bys and nonsence
But it makes sense how I survive from 1974 to 1995
Through the grace of God I probably make it
Stayed drug free so my mind stays elevated
I must be presdestined for damnation
Through this firery nation I see the obliteration of my race and
We can't win for losing drug selling and using
Cops abusing us for doing the same thing white folks be doing
The prognosis of a diagnosis of a disease called melanin
Given to me by God the prescription is irrelevant
the symptoms are evident that I'm a black man
Half man half God, but steadily faceing harassment
Sexual molestation double murder and drug trafficing
Put together by a society to shut down the African

Hook:
Yo check your egos at the door 
And do a little searching of your soul can you feel me?       (x4)

Verse 2:
Why do brothers smoke blunts and love to front?
And hump stunts and brag about all the chumps they punk
Do they figure they bigger if they pull triggers
Take a swig of the 40 and lie about smoking?
Please save that for the dramma coarse
What kind of man are smoking weed on your mama's porch?
Playa you ain't hard at all I'm appalled at your bullshhhh
Can you catch a bullet walk on water 
Spit fire and resurrect yourself?
Uh ah didn't think so so yo check yourself
I need to check myself as well
Hell never been in jail but right now ain't livin' to swell
Dealt a card but I didn't play it right
Procrastinating of life and hanging out all night
And nothing to show but sleepy eyes
Hangin' out with the wrong tribe I need a different type vibe
Strive to survive in the wild wild west
Side kids I kicked it with have died
Seems like stress is on my mind or my mind is on stress
The best thing about stress is that I can sell it to the rest

Hook

Verse 3:
But you can't understand this process
I can't progress I'm jobless should I rob this bank?
Just to get some crubms in my wallet?
But I can't do time so how should I call it?
I got to learn to hustle see it's a struggle
See life is a trip and it gets real tough bro
And I don't know if I can preceed
I need weed, huh too many of my homies are deceased
And who will be the next to go?
I 'm sick of funerals I been to two in a row
And four more in six months
Why does life suck especially when I ain't got no bucks?

Hook

Outro:
Yeah yeah Mykill 1995
Vooodu kickin' it live on the trizzack west coast baby.

"Sweet!"

[Intro: Rick Ross] 
Self made...
Gotta handle your own... {M-M-M-Maybach Music}
{J-J-J-J-J-Just Blaze} ...I'mma handle mine

[Wale] + (Rick Ross)
They tried and tell me I don't fit up in this motha fucka
Cause Rozay been talkin white he think he Uncle Ruckus (HUH)
I left Jimmy, they was spending silly with my budget
And now I'm rolling with some cooler niggas I can fuck with (HUH)
You by the cooler yea you niggas don't get no tick
Bitch I think I'm Teen Wolf, a dog nigga, ballin' bitch (HUH)
Fly as Ricky steam boat, me and my Moschino
I dont wear no 501's: 1000 dollar jeans flow (WHOO)
It's funny how Pucci made all the snakes gone (WHOO)
I'm winning cause Ricky made my mistakes known (WHOO)
Its funny that since I put this chain on
These bitches appear quicker than state farm
Wale Folarin somethin they can't ever smoke
Weed I can't pronounce man this shit would leave Rosetta stoned
This man can single handedly save the culture (HUH)
You got no spark you need some lighter man you Sammy Sosa
So get it right ok you ballin and I'm with the owners
You know my drive is retarded like I'm riding doughnuts
Picture me rollin': young, handsome and focused
Got that vision of Pac and though my branding is Oprah
Michelangelo portrait meet Maya Angelou notebook
Michael Jordan performance nigga I dream to be all of it (WHOO)
Yea, I'm just a poet with some hangtime
I dont really shakespeare, I just shake dice (HUH)
Miami nights, made a couple grand (right)
Private plane TSA can kiss my ass (haha)
Lord forgive me I'm trying, know I ain't living right (HUH)
But this card I'm trickin' with got no limit right
In this life you dead wrong or ain't living right
They on my ass like a center make them take a hike

[Meek Mill] + (Rick Ross)
(All we wanted was opportunity; Lord knows~!)
It's MMG baby - the dream team (better believe)

Uh, I made it myself, guess I'm self made (HUH)
Fire starter put me anywhere I just blaze
Dropped out of school never made it to the 12th grade
I'm so fucking raw haters hoping that I catch AIDS (WHOO)
Motivated just from being broke (WHOO)
Had a dream like Martin Luther, little bit of hope
If Rosa never rolled and Malcolm never spoke
They'd probably find me in the woods hanging from a rope
Instead they lock me in the cell just for sellin dope
When people used to ask if I was high, I would tell them no
Cause I was never hesitant to represent
Devil knocking at the door screaming let me in
Tell the owner hit the lights when we stepping in
Charlie Sheen on them haters, they dont wanna let me win
Nah, niggas they dont wanna let me win
But I'mma build it ground up, (let's again)
I kill these rappers early in the game, abortion
Spit a verse like lemme get ya fam, extortion
Send these niggas back to when they came, deportion
Make'm forefeit and I'm porshin 600 horses
911, somebody call 'em
Kemba Walker cross em over, somebody fallin
Jump back, I hit the shot, somebody ballin
I'm at the dealer and I hear that Maserati callin
Black and white diamonds looking like my neck be vollyballin
And this presi lookin like somebody pottied on it
I don't gotta join illuminati just to get a new Bugatti
I'm just ridin I done put a thousand miles on my body

[Interlude: Rick Ross]
Born to win - look around
From the projects to the penthouse
Our vision never changed, we self made
Count that up - HUH~!

[Pill] + (Rick Ross)
Hah, self made self paid man
P-I double L in the building
(ATL) Go on and get yo muthafuckin roll on...

8 in the morning when that street clock bust: kitchen overload
Door knob turns; the aisle burn baking soda pourin'
The clientele buy and sell like a pawn shop
Profit margings increase, exit the V wit my gun out
Out witted, out foxed you over matched
House hidden, drop tops the sofas match
This is fine dine take out, first date make out
Diamonds blind the lens and camera men on the stakeout
As I enter the steak house pockets on humongo
Philosphical drama and wildin known as the congo?
Africana, Black as Ghana, be my attire
Mary water, marajuana that stick to get higher?
We blow stress through the vents of the Marriott (HUH)
We self made, carry on while we carry out

[Outro: Rick Ross]
If I woke up tomorrow and didn't have a dolla..
As long as I have my heart, I can get it all over
Dream team - we the '93 Chicago Bulls baby
The lovely Teedra Moses, self made...

Look at that bitch, shit! Hey!

There she goes, shakin that ass on the flo'
Bumpin and grindin that pole
The way she's grindin that pole (yeah, yeah)
I think I'm losing control (Bobby, Bobby, Bobby CREEK!)

[Bobby Creekwater]
I bought a girl Patron, I get in the Henn' I'm gone
My eyes ain't clear and I'm long so she hearin me wrong
I'm kinda in the zone cause the DJ playin my song
Just another opportunity for sayin I'm known
I'm from Atlanta, so Southern ain't just a part of my grammar
I can dump and cock my hammer for any nigga with ammo
But I came here to get on Goose and Tropicana
Get loose, put some more in my juice and your caboose
Sippin everything from white cran to deuce-deuce
With nothin to gain but my grains and loose tooths
Eminem came, then Obie, Stat and Proof too
Bobby Creek is in the place, the name is new too
But the money been around, my drinks is ten around
I can make her spin around, least she keep her dinner down
Simmer down, we can hit the telly when the fun stops
And I let you and your girl come tickle my gumdrops, yo

[Nate Dogg]
Three to the one from the one to the three
I met a bad bitch last night in the D
Let me tell you how I made her leave with me
Conversation and Hennessy
I've been to the motherfuckin mountain top
Heard motherfuckers talk, seen 'em drop
If I ain't got a weapon I'ma pick up a rock
And when I bust yo' ass I'm gon' continue to rock
Getcha ass of the wall with your two left feet
It's real easy just follow the beat
Don't let that fine girl pass you by
Look real close cause strobe lights lie

We 'bout to have a party - turn the music up
Let's get it started - go 'head and shake your butt
I'm lookin for a girl with a body and a sexy strut
Wanna get it poppin baby step right up
Some girls they act retarded
Some girls are bout it, bout it
I'm lookin for a girl that will do whatever the fuck
I say everyday she be givin it up

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
Now shake, that, ass for me - shake that ass for me
C'mon girl shake, that, ass for me - shake that ass for me
Aw girl shake, that, ass for me - shake that ass for me
C'mon girl shake, that, ass for me - shake that ass for me

[Eminem] OBIE TRICE!

[Obie Trice]
One slug couldn't snuff young cuz
Goodness gracious, haters stay on his nuts
Wood just like a hoodrat chick who was curious
Serious full breast ready to touch
Who's that in the Coupe blew back with a blue new hat
givin head while he poppin the clutch?
True that I had a few, Obie rollin with brutes
And Nathaniel annually knockin the boots
It's all manual the way I get 'em outta they shoes
Talk a lil' shit then they anus'll ooze
Hock a lil' spit on my dang-a-lang boo
It's Sha-dy; you know the name of the crew
You know the aim is to bang you in a mansion
With a Magnum when the night came to the matinee
Mathers, Nate, Obie – came to party
You better ask somebody

I'm a harbinger of death with a flow otherworldly
Cancer cluster that wasn't discovered early
Shittin on you 'til your body covered thoroughly
My quotes cockblock throats
'Til MC's unable to respond
Like I just told a homeless person a knock knock joke
Malicious; tattooed F.U.N. on my dick
For "Fuck You Niggaz" while I poke fun at yo' bitch
Leavin spitters missin vowels, shitters disemboweled
The last one you clearly wouldn't doubt
Niggaz won't consider dissin now
Fuck punchlines and metaphors; I settle wars
spittin darts 'til puncture wounds look like an extra set of pores
I'm morally sick and auspicious, all vicious
Quick to jaw bitches 'til they chin hit the ground like drawbridges
Potnah, yo' whole style Ichabod Crane
I'm leavin all you riders headless when I squeeze off these Sleepy Hollows
and pick apart brains, blow to smidgens
My shit on point like infrared scopes strapped on the ass of homing pigeons

Mashin' on the gas and them got it by the grill

Showin' up and blowin' up I know I'm lookin' good

Hit the school zone, four 18's shook it
Caught that boy Gottie sideways sittin' crooked

[Eminem] Remix!

[50 Cent]
Yeah, I'm tryin to catch me somethin
A little jux or somethin

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Nigga that watch is nice, that's what you bought for me?
That chain is nice, that's what you bought for me?
Them earrings is nice, that's what you bought for me?
Take that shit off, move I'll break you off properly

[Verse One]
You wan' spray at me go 'head; the last nigga that tried
got hit, keeled over, and bled 'til he died
Your lil' sister callin me stupid, reason why
her and your momma in the living room now hogtied
I came up with two new ways to get rich, I can't wait
Got a brand new cig in that ol' 38
I be schemin to put a lil' bread on my plate
Watch and dress shirts, stomp through a hole in the cake
I stick a nigga for his shine, sell him back the next day
You thought I really want it you pussy?  Bitch please
This is stashhouse, jackpot, there go them ki's
My black G-Unit hoodie just wreak with marijuana
Cocaine comin out my pores in the sauna
I'm serious man, I'm so sincere
This the flow right here that fucked up Jeffrey's career
Make money, take money, yeah nigga, YEAH

[Chorus]

[Interlude: 50 Cent]
I get mine the fast way, the ski mask way
Make money, make money money money
Nigga if you ask me, this the only way
Take money, take money money money

[Verse Two]
Who's that peepin in my window?
WOW - the feds on me now
They know when I'm sleepin, they know when I'm wake
I know they got my phone tapped, I'm screamin fuck Jake
I'm tryin to stay out them pens, so I switched states
Bad News, VA - now that sounds great
I see niggaz with that ice on, rims shined up
This town's one big pussy, waitin to get fucked
I holla at A.I. peoples to get gats
They charge me 500 apiece for two macs
Then I'm back doin me, back out on the spree
Catch me and niggaz slippin out pumpin that D
Get me a little crew I'll have 'em pumpin for me
The more product I take the more paper we see
Change my name, in NY they don't know where I be
Yeah a nigga doin dirt, but a nigga low-key

[Chorus]

Typed by: Nickolye16@aol.com

[Akon] Shady, Konvict, Upfront...

[Chorus: Akon]
I feel you creepin I can see it from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gulatto
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae-Bo
And possibly bend ya over
Look back and watch me smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-ohhh-oh-ohh
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-ohhh-oh-ohh

[Akon]
Shorty if you wanna ride you can ride on me
We can bump heads and collide on me
Want beef, damn right can rely on me
To bring that Campbell like Naomi
Just pull that girl and take it on easy
Lookin all oiled up and all greasy
Bout that time you stop that teasin
Way that you drop done got me here cheesin
What's funny is that you takin
all my money for real
I rather spend it on you
Right now than my homie's bail
And I can see that's what you're made fo'
And ain't ever been no lame ho
With that booty bought and paid fo'
Won't move 'til you on my payroll!

[Chorus]

[Stat Quo]
Yeah, yeah, Stat Quo! Ahhh!
I love when you do it girl move to it like you're used to it
Drop it down I wanna put my thang through it
To the crib we go, go fast and slow
Make it twirl like a stripper slide down my pole
Shawty ass so swole got your boy like whoa
One night with me now she wanna marry Stat Quo
But I'm like no, let's keep it on the low
On occasion let me come through and tap that hole
Make you lose control and all her girls know
that I hit it right at night, I'm a pro
I only come 'round and get sexual
if she flexible and bisexual
I might stay around for a longer time
Only if, only if she can blow my mind
I can hurt that, murk that, work that spine
Now she in love and wants to be mine
Stat Quo, YEA!

[Chorus]

[Bobby Creekwater]
Yeah, it's Bobby Creek, know'msayin?
The ice in the watch reflects the light to her
The money quite green and the ice light bluer
The swag might kill her so I said good night to her
She don't want me to leave I can see right through her
So we, dipped out, burn one trip out
Get low like Caribbean limbo
Didn't go out like light, baby girl get right
Head so swole my hat don't fit right
We can cruise in the car or we could take flight
The middle of the night, make your body +8+ like
+Mike Vick+ against the Eagles
Call myself a king cause I'm regal
To be this hot is not legal
But we don't care, listen baby it's a fact that
if you drop back I'ma quarterback sack that
We can go deep and I can shark attack that
Say you don't remember where your keys and your hat at?

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

Chorus: Chiko Dateh
Come fly with me (Let's get fly)
Take a hit of mari (Let's get fly)
We huffin', huffin', huffin' (Let's get fly)
We puffin', puffin', puffin' (Let's get fly)
Come fly with me (Let's get fly)
Take a hit of mari (Let's get fly)
We huffin', huffin', huffin' (Let's get fly)
We puffin', puffin', puffin'

(Verse 1)
[Ese Daz]     Wouldn't you like to go with me
            On a peaceful journey
            Striken and smokin' with my lady
            When I meet her, I'm in paradise
            Silky brown skin with those sparkling green eyes
            Let's fly
            Let's go
            In and out, we in the zone
            Ignite the flame
            Get rid of my pain
            One on one
            Me and you
            Come on, mari, let's get it on
            I'm sprung and twisted, mentally gifted
            Your love's got me physically addicted
[El Fino]     Excuse me
            While I kiss the sky
            It's time to get high, with a little help from the F.L.Y.
            Take a hit of the Maui, Maui
            Get lit
            Grab mari by the hips, as she touches my lips
            She's like a doorknob
            Everybody gets a turn
            Stop
            Pass it to Johnny, let it burn
            Let it fly, consume your soul and be free
[Chiko Dateh] Get up, stand up, come fly with me

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 2: Johnny D]
Sit back, relax and enjoy ya ride
We tell ya ways up N.Y.D., from Killer Cali, Spanish F.L.Y.
Got ya lifted, take grassy green feels in the sky
Don't trip
Everyday's a high night
With some
Model chicks and some fool in the mix
Bouncin' up and down to the latest F.L.Y. hits
Forget about your trouble, nobody burstin' bubbles
Everybody, form a huddle, we puffin' on that trouble
What

Break: Ese Daz
I huff and Puff like The Magic Dragon
Burning Down The House (One man standin')
You gotta get up, get out and light somethin'
Roll it up, light it up, get fly
You gotta get up, get out and light somethin'
Spanish F.L.Y., 310, when we ride
You gotta get up, get out and light somethin'
Like Cheech and Chong, we can all get fly
Let's go

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 3)
[El Fino]     Kick off your shoes and relax your mind
[Chiko Dateh] Sittin' on top of the world
[El Fino]     On Cloud 9
            Like a star in the sky, lookin' down, watchin' time fly
            we spark it up like the 4th of July
            Come on in
            The door is open
            Puff, puff, give
            We got it smokin'
            It don't stop til the last ass drops
            Disturbin' the peace, and don't call the cops (Hey)
[Chiko Dateh] Come on, let's roll, let's ride, get fly
[Johnny D]    To the limit
            Grab a drink and step into my mind
            Picture this
            Then I pass it to the right of me
            Freaks be, jumpin' in the sack, to fly with me
            Drastic
            If I ain't got none in my system
            I had a chance, to get some fluffy, but I had to diss
[Chiko Dateh] So, just come fly with me
[Johnny D]    Daz
            Ace, Fino and Johnny D

Repeat Chorus

[Chiko Dateh]
Let's get fly
Let's get fly

Let's get fly
Let's get fly

Song:   Smooth Sailing
Typed by: Cno Evil

[Ghostface Killah]
Yo, behind those mahogany walls
Indoor pools with steel doors, flipping eggs over in my silk drawers
While I"m charging my cell, sparking the L
Baby mother reading my mail, just that they switched seats
To another jail, and his banger is old fire
He's locked up with them dudes from the fucking Wire
That's when I passed her the bone, started to cough
And flossed all through the house, robe on, ruger out
Homebuyers see the sign, yeah ya'll, I'm moving out
In front of the crib, niggas flipped, I had to shoot it out
Thirty G, living room sets, porcelain plates
With big giant wall units, even the front grass
Saw your boy doing it, Tone Stark he'll never fall
I even put work in, under the floor
In the box with the ox, and my skeleton jaw
Tell 'em soldiers I'm in the bush if the President call

[Chorus: Solomon Childs]
Get 'em, the'll be nothing but smooth sailing
When the heat shot, now your crew's bailing
I refuse to bow down, refuse to lay down
Go five and turn, to let the biz, all I found

[Solomon Childs]
Where the fuck is the kids crown?
Lady luck breathing all over the dikes
With 745 airlines, the color of Cajun rice
This the passion of Christ, done seen it and felt it all
Til rats shit in my boots, like how the fuck the rats get in my boots
A brown metal that sizzles, wrap up more dead meat then riddles
Injuries that have you missing more games than Kerry Kittles
There's a war going on outside, you hear the fiddles?
And you so called 'units', go 'head and jump
And get your body severed apart with pumps

[Trife Diesel]
Aiyo, watch who you talk around, cuz ya'll seen niggas snitching
And they quick to turn on you like keys in the ignition
Niggas start submitting, when them slugs is spitting
And believe me, that shit'll hurt like when your drugs is missing
Yo, these bullets ain't thug resistant, and they see a nigga dying
Choking off his own blood is sickening
Picture that, now picture this, picture me running in your lab
Like Allen Iverson waving the fifth
But this ain't no domestic dispute, go 'head and get cute
Force my hand, and see if I'm connected with loot
Somebody gon' find your body on the stitching of the roof
The art of gunplay, I stay perfected when I shoot
And this ain't a lottery, but ya'll dudes can 'take seven'
The slugs'll have your ass 'burning up' like Faith Evans
Facial expressions change when you're facing that weapon
Nigga, your ass gon' die, try to escape within sessions

(DJ DMD)
I represent P.A., down for my block
Been reppin' since the 7th grade still won't stop
I'm down with OG's pumpin' nothin' but them old's
Ballin' ass niggas keepin' me in studios
I puts it down tight, tight like White
These gangsta ass beats keep my pockets feelin' right
My click's so real, bout to make a mill
I got to pack a steel in the land of the trill
Been listenin' in to Screw, since 9-2
Niggas talk shit, but whatcha wanna do?
I'm comin' from P.A. where niggas rollin' like g's
Rolllin' on d's, smokin' on trees
Drinkin' hennessy in the lac on Vogues
Chevy 6-4's, Monte Carlo's
Bangin' in the clubs, bangin' on the streets
Got everybody bobbin' to these bangin' ass beats
Fool, it's so real

(Chorus (Al-D singing in the background) x4)
G's in P.A., g's in the city, g's in the South so real

(DJ DMD)
What's your name, fool?

(DJ Screw)
Dj Screw, slowin' shit down, puttin' in work
All over H-Town, send me on the scene, drinkin' codeine
Get up off my lap cause these haters want my green
Southside for life, that's what I claim
That's what I represent, that's where I hang
Hand on the trigger, pockets gettin' bigger
Screwed Up Click ain't nuttin' but real niggas

(Al-D)
Ridin' on Vogues, pimpin' hoes, slammin' Cadillac doors
Jays on my toes, locs fallin' off my nose
Screwed up and screwed out, in doors and out doors
No need for the tint, the kill is foggin' up my windows
Jelly on my ride, but I often side
Red in my pocket glock cocked on my side
Southside for life, this is Al-D
Peace to Rodney, KeKe, and E.S.G., we so real

(Chorus (Al-D singing in the background) x4)
G's in the city, g's in P.A., g's in the South so real

(DJ DMD)

(DJ DMD)
We got to keep it real, playa, let's do this

(Al-D)
It's 1-9-9-6, got the South sold
Headed to the East fo' they cream and they gold
Load up the West fo' they triple gold d's
Midwest g's, got them on they knees
Going overseas with the boat and sippin' yak
Showing Europeans how these Southern niggas act
Bangin' in the clubs, bangin' on the streets
Got everybody bobbin' to these bangin' ass beats
Fool, it's so real

(Chorus (Al-D singing in the background) x8)
G's in P.A., g's in the city, g's in the South so real

[Lil' Rob]
Hey what's up baby
Yeah, they call me Lil' Rob
Yeah, that's me
Kicking back with my homeboy Royal T
And my homeboy Yogi
You know what I mean
San Diego's finest, you know what I'm saying
What's your name

[Lil' Rob]
Como te llamas, perdonan mis vapas
Donde estavas en toda mi vida
I've never seen a señorita more bonita
My name is Lil' Rob, nice to mean ya
Wish that I could eat ya, keep you to myself, to myself, to the side
You says lets hold off things for the ride, much obliged
You replied if you decide to see me again
Just give me a ring, I'm sitting for a frigging weekend
You're my freaky bona, cabrona, chichona, pinche nalgona
I've got what you want, and you've got what I want
We both like what we see, I like the way you love me
With you soft Brown skin, Mexican, big brown eyes
As I trip on with Mary Wells to that one guy, Miles Standby
When I tell you to jump you ask how high
Even if I expect you to fly, it's time for me to fly
But you tell me what's so good about good-bye

[Chorus x2: Lil' Rob]
I can't stick around, ain't got time to dick around
If you wanna get down let's get down, let's get down
(So what you wanna do)
I can't stick around, ain't got time to dick around
If you wanna get down let's get down, let's get down
(So what you wanna do)

[Royal T]
I blow hynas like golf reel, long and slow
Cuz I'm dangerous like a SEAL, when I get at a hoe
Guaranteed to get her wet like a walk in the rain
And after we stroke they be like "What's your name?"
I say "Mr. Sancho, the one hitter then quitter
The True Player baby, the puss go-getter"
See my Lex in eighteens, you know what that means
Another day, a few more hoes when I come up on the scene
Ain't no player in the streets who play the game like me
You tight? You might be, but like me? That's unlikely
Better hose it down cuz I holds that crown
And I never player hate because I hold my ground
They call me papi from San Diego to Puerto Rico
And everybody knows ain't no guarantee like Chico
Five minutes of converstation and that's all she wrote
Sipping Alize, puffing hydro smoke

[Chorus x2]

[Lil' Rob]
Let's get down, that's right
San Diego Clique
Don't act like you don't know us
Lil' Rob, Royal T, Mr. Yogi
Ponle

[Yogi]
Shave my head pelon for the get up and go look
Hit the avenue, I'm putting freaks in my phonebook
You know I just be chilling with my cousin Rancho
You wasn't trying to deal with me before my demo
But now you be screaming out "Papi, te quiero"
Trying to front like you got class, but you just ghetto
I love pretty things on the dance floor
Glitter on your chest, g-strings, and platforms
You know the type of babydoll that make your knees weak
Sipping mixed drinks, real super freaks
The type of broads like like to chill in Mexico
Acting stuck up, sporting them sexy clothes
Knew her when she was chica, mira que bonita
Now she's with amigas, me rolling with clickas
I'ma juela la jolita, what's up mamacita
I be trying to maintain, just chilling in my villa

[Intro: Ant Banks] 
Hah yeah, Right about now
Ant Banks and J-Dubb in the mothafuckin' house
Oakland is in mothafuckin' full effect
Aiy, mothafucker kick the beat in 
And let's do what we do
You understand what I'm saying?
Aiy yo, J, what the fuck we gonna call this shit?
Tell them what you named is
 
[J-Dubb]
Yeah, Something Like That
 
[Ant Banks]
Well, let's do it
 
[J-Dub]
Back by demand, now we big as fuck
Because you was the public, you should know what's up
Big Thangs got us swoll, it was more than gold
It was the hit cause it was based on some crazy shit
So our final conclusion, has been permitted
Punks made us a target and knew that we would hit it
But that was a part of showbizz
 
[Ant Banks]
Aiy yo homeboy
Why don't you tell them what your name is?
 
[J-Dub]
Now, for the record it's Dub, and on the streets it's Villain
Squares keep chillin' cause I'm peelin' like Matt Dillon
On Gunsmoke, but I ain't the man of the law
I'm livin' raw, smokin' weed by the nuts with cough
And pullin' stuff
Niggaz better check their necks
I put a hex and shoot with slugs
And all the wrecks with techs and bullet vest
And every bitch I met would bet I kept it wet
Cause I'ma pimp but don't sweat
And players don't test
Now, who the man in the mass? 
There ain't no reason to ask, I'm just gettin' my cash
Cause that's the part of the showbizz "ha ah"
Aiy yo homeboy 
 
[Ant Banks]
What's up ?
 
[J-Dubb]
Why don't you tell them what your name is?
 
[Ant Banks]
Ant Banks, the Big Bad Ass
The nigga that's known for twistin' bitches when I tap that ass
I leave them stuck on stupid "stupid?"
And known for stressin' "uha"
So now, let's get the motherfuckin' session goin'
Flowin, it's time to start throwin'
Rhymes, so keep in mind all the Dollars I'm foldin'
When everybody knew in the time "yeah"
I'm just a down ass mothafucker goin' for mine
Unlike a lot of niggaz who claim they're gettin' busy
Tryin' to be like me but can't fuck with me
You need to quit runnin' off with the mouth
And nigga thank you, for stop puttin' that bullshit out
It's not hard mothafucker, you could do it fool
Tryin' to make somethin' funky and original
You're either talkin' about busters and bitches
What you gonna do, "yep" or you can't do shit
 
[Ant Banks] 
Ha ha awww yeah
That's what I'm talkin' about, Dubb
These mothafuckers don't know what mothafuckin' time it is, nigga
Fuck it (*Burp*)
I guess we gotta kick another verse 
 
[Ant Banks & J-Dubb]
This is real shit, somethin' to fuck with your ear
J and Banks will appear, the pimps of the ear
To fuck it up like we always do, and that's the trick
Sayin' some shit to make the bitches wanna suck our dicks
But it's an everyday thang
Of the heezy, for sheezy, with the Oakland slang
Bitch, now we're back in the house and your appartment
So open your door, by the way, so we can start it
Test the monitors and the call is mic
Cause the way we feel, we're gonna fuck it up tonight (*Echoes*)
 
[Ant Banks]
Awww yeah, Ant Banks and J-Dubb
Yeah, shootin' much respect out to them Old School, O.G. Niggaz
N.W. mothafuckin' A
Yeah, you know what I'm saying?
Aiy yo J, what fuck we gonna call this shit
Tell them what you named this?
 
[J-Dubb]
Yeah, Something Like That

Song:   Stack on My Belt
Typed by: Cedmaster3K

[Intro: DJ Scream]
Self-Made niggas man, you already know
I remember we use to watch the coke dry
Now a nigga crib gotta a boat dock
MMG navy nigga, high tide sellers
D.C. air-force, G-5s are better, you already know nigga
All gold sky-dwellers, fly nigga shit
Bel Air sippin', Ciroc pissin', foreign car dippin'
Young black millionaires nigga, we build the empires

[Chorus: Rick Ross]
I spend a stack on my belt, I swear you niggas are watchin'
I gave a stack to my bitch, she the shit out the project
Spend a stack on my belt, therefore you bitches are stalkin'
A half a mill on the car, that's why you niggas are talkin'
Spend a stack on my belt, as if you think I was floggin'
Spend a stack on my belt, and you could still see my boxers
Spend a stack on my belt, that how I blew your deposits
Stack on the belt, double M this shit poppin'

[Rick Ross]
Spend a stack on my belt, got bitches askin' my name
Spend a stack on the belt, she like fuck how we came
Double all in the front, ya'll niggas stay in your lane
Spend a stack on my belt, don't even ask 'bout the change
Spend a stack on the belt, cause I knew she a wife
Spend a stack on the belt, cause my fooleys on time
Spend a stack on the belt, I got your bitch on my mind
{M-M-M-M-M-M-Maybach Music} The world is mine

[Chorus]

[Wale]
Spend a stack on my belt, better tell these rappers to chill
Hold up that's Hermes, more H and I be more trap that's for real
And I got mosquino, Ye know that R.I.P. flow, here go
That type of freak show, with three shows that we don't need no more help
That Givenchy go for three, just me Rozay and the cleese
I make these bitches suck on Cs, you make them suck on there teeth, let's get it
Ralph, Klauph, meow, they bounce
We hit, ab-lib, your BITCH, I'm out
Stack on the belt, just know that's nothing to me
My soldiers real in the 'ville, you WWE
Of course we see them punks faking, but we leave them slump shaking
Don't believe your cane stories, I should leave ya'll undertaking
A stack on my belt, 250 my ride
Went from renting these motherfuckers to owning 4 with no miles
I pray my souls is in tact, passion in the bulk of my rhyme
And when I hit that heat game I'm this close to LeBron
I'm gone

[Chorus]

[Whole Slab]
I'm burnin' the back, I'm swervin' Maybach
I Versace my belt, I done Hermes my flag
Got a stack around my waist, keep my bitch on the leash
She goin' eat this head up, on this dick she goin' feast
Time fuck with the pleats, my place is packed
Red hoes in my stable, ya my babies is bad
She spent a stack on my belt, now she callin' me father
[?] Balenciagas, giving mollies to models
I manage these strippers, Giuseppe's with zippers
Playing with the whole slab, niggas started with niggas
Rose gold on my wrist, rose gold on my shades
Spend a stack on my belt, 100 done on my face

[Birdman]
Spend a stack on my belt, so I could stunt when I shine
Get the mac off the shelf, keep these pussies in line
Spend a stack on my belt, 10 at the bar
Blow a mill on a whip serving niggas that raw
Spend a stack on the belt, Versace my kind
Put 5 on his life, put 5 in his mind
Spend a stack on the belt, bitch we the real niggas
Plaques on the wall, born to kill niggas - BLAAAT~!

[Outro: DJ Scream] + (Birdman)
Stack on that belt, ho {M-M-M}
Stack on that belt, ho {M-M}
Spend a stack on the belt, ho
Gotta stack for the freak show
On her knees and she open like a {DYKE}

Typed by: Lil Hustle

(*singing*)

[Hook: Ronnie Spencer - 2X]
I'm, feeling like a star tonight
Top fly ladies, at the bar tonight
I'm about, to get the party hype
Feeling, like a star tonight

[A3]
Well I'ma slide in the mix, sitting low on a switch
Hit it hard like brick, lil' daddy I won't miss
You boys must forgot, when we crawl through the lot
We come to wreck shop, niggaz getting body rocked
Make it drop flip-flop, hoes keep your lips locked
Barberry strawberry, candy paint white top
You can do it on the scene, it's every playa's dream
I'm fool mine's, and always saturated on lean
We dodge the playa-hation, pimp game conversation
To pull a throwed bop, and commit penetration
Scoop her living for partnas, you ain't know then look around
Be ready for H-Town, it's going all the way down come on

[Hook - 2X]

[Big Moe]
I pulled up at the club, parking lot pimping
No mo' white cups, but a playa still sipping
You know me M-O-E, I get my buzz on
A dime piece, and I ain't taking no scrubs home
You gotta face me, or even taste me
(what it taste like), Bar Baby
That's, the sweet taste
Better known down here, as a skee taste
Everytime I step out, and hit the club
I valet hit the do', and all the thugs showing love
Moe V.I.P., and all dranks for free
I appreciate the love you shown, now all dranks on me

[Hook - 2X]

[Killa Milla]
I'm feeling ice cold, like the middle of winter
Throwback blue and gold, like a Astro simmer
I make this sound simple, so go on do the math
Killa Milla plus cash, equals a throwback slab
Got some throwback rims, they were born in '78
Grew in cherry year, 24 inches to date
24 switches to break, add eight to sixteen
Put a Benz in it's place, 2000 and 3
23 inch Spre's, inside the dots they spotted
At 600 so I speed, I leave that hoe topless
Took the wrist and I rocked it, Cardier doing time
Got the face behind boys, looking like a diamond mine
He make these diamonds shine, I'm talking bout Johnny
He compliments my rhymes, I'm talking bout Ronnie
Noke D on the track, and his shit's the hottest
Leave me behind the wheel, cause he know that I got this
Now watch this, I act guards like Emmitt Smith
My spinners it simmer-simmers, on side of his helmet
And oh boy, I'm feeling like a star tonight
Ring side, at the Tyson fight man

[Hook - 3X]

I'm feeling like a star tonight

Step, step, step, step, step off
Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft, uh-huh.
Step, step, step, step, step off
Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft, uh-huh-huh.
Step, step, step, step, step off
Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft.

[Verse 1: Melle Mel]
I was sittin' on the corner just a-wastin' my time
When I realised I was the king of the rhyme.
I got on the microphone and what do you see?
Huh, the rest was my legacy.
I was born to be the king of the be-bop swing,
To have stallions and medallions, big diamond rings.
I own a castle and a yacht, two million in gold
Because rap is the game that I control.
I'm like Shakespeare, I'm a pioneer
Because I made rap somethin' people wanted to hear.
See, before my reign, it was the same old same,
"To the ba with the ba", that street-talk game,
So if you ever, let me make this clear,
If you ever think that we're steppin' out of here,
You ever think you're gettin' up, down, around or in,
Huh huh, you better think again, my friend
Because the door is closed and we're in town
And the only place you can go is dowwwwwwwwwwn!
(Oohweeoohweeoohweeooooooooooooooooooooooohh.
 Step, step, step, step, step off.)

[Cowboy]
Well, I'm Kieth Cowboy and you're my cow,
So what you MC's gonna do now?
It's gonna be a slaughter and here's my plan.
You won't even get bread and water, my man.
Gonna put you on the racks like a pair of slacks
With another wack rapper tied to your back,
And if you wanna hang yourself out to dry,
It's te beautiful round-up in the sky.
I'm the carry-out kid when my trigger's in cock.
I'll be carryin' out bodies stiff as a rock.
Carryin' out a million dollars in my pockets and hand,
But I carry out orders from no man,
'Cause anything you wanna do, I already did.
You used to see me rock the house when you was a kid,
But in my MC school, my class is packed
And tricks are for kids so I left your ass back.
The bow-legged brother, there'll never be another.
I buy a mansion for my mother.
The 24/7, the Kool-Aid smile,
Say, "Hey, crack a lemon and look at my pile."

(Repeat chorus)

[Verse 2: Scorpio]
Come on.
Now you know just who I am
And what I do because I'm in demand,
Because I look good.
Do you hear, my man?
And if you can't take that, you chump your old hand.
One girl at a time get an MC
So how could you think that you rank with me?
If you only did your homework, you would surely find
When Scorp' get girls, they all be fine
And the only girl that you could take of mine
Is the one that I left way behind
And plus you're cheap, you're petty, your music is trash.
You need to go to the bank and get some cash
Because talkin' don't pay, you're driftin' away.
When I see you on the stage, I'm-a blow you away.
You're right.
There is no diff between me and you
Except I look good and you look through.
Take that.

(Repeat last two lines of chorus)

[Verse 3: Melle Mel]
Little pieces of a dream is all you mean
Since the day you stepped into the MC scene.
Bitin' your moves, takin' fake awards,
Sayin' everyone else is perpetratin' the frauds,
But you're nothin' but a clone of a flesh and bone.
Now you're tryin' to play gone on the microphone,
But I tell you 'bout a night and you know I'm right
When you listen to us rockin' to the broad daylight,
And then you looked in the sky and you started to cuss,
But then you prayed to God that you could be like us.
Then God was great and God was true
And he tried to show you how to be like you,
But you still didn't get where you wanted to go
When you gathered in a group and got your own show
'Cause without the source, the force won't survive.
For eternity, the source is alive.
You forgot the words of your creator
And now he's made you a perpetrator, 
Forever in a world of you and a girl,
A few grams in a pipe to make your head swirl.
You must spread the words of the master teacher.
You die by the rhymes and the streets'll eat you.
The words are a gift we will never flaunt.
That's why we're gonna get everything we want.
Just like a shadow in the night on a sight unseen
And I'm the bonafide vocal master supreme,
And I'm here to run it down for the ladies and gents
For my rhymes make dollars plus they make sense,
See, you're down with Cowboy, you'll be rockin' the show.
With King Lu, Tommy Gun and, huh, Scorpio,
Kamikaze Clayton Savage and Easy Mike
And goin' down in the books is the king of the night,
So if you're ever in a battle, I'm-a make you my slave
And I'm-a give you a shovel so you can dig a grave.
Leave behind all your fame and wealth
So you can say one rhyme, then bury yourself, huh.
I mnay sound possessed, but you know I'm blessed
With the will to make sense of all this mess.
I'm the power of the sun that shines in the sky
And I'm the only MC that'll never die,
So just rock and don't stop 'til you hit the top,
But when you see Mellie Mel, you're gonna have to drop.
RRRAHHH!
And not only that,

(Repeat first four lines of chorus)

[Verse 4: Melle Mel]
And for all you MC's, you heard my story
On my super-fly, cold-crushin' fame and glory,
How I rocked the children and the young ladies.
I even rocked the country that was overseas
'Cause I can rock anybody from any crew.
Because I did it to Chaka, I'm-a do it to you.
I'm-a show you how I rocked it, y'all, all night long,
But when I rocked with Chaka Khan, I just said,
"Chaka Khan, let me rock you, let me rock you, Chaka Khan.", I said, 
"Let me rock you, that's all I wanna do. 
Chaka Khan, let me rock you, let me rock you, Chaka Khan.", I said.
"Let me me rock you 'cause I feel for you.
Chaka Khan, won't you tell me what you wanna do?
Do you feel for me the way I feel for you.
Chaka Khan, let me tell you what I wanna do.
I wanna love you, wanna hug you, wanna squeeze you too,
So let me take me in your arms, let me fill you with my charms, Chaka
'Cause you know that I'm the one to keep you warm, Chaka.
I'll make you more than just a physical spell.
I wanna rock you, Chaka baby, 'cause my name is Mellie Mel."

(Instrumental break)

[Verse 5: Melle Mel]
Say what, y'all.
Say what.

To the DJ scratch, the metro match
'Cause we're comin' out fresh with a brand new batch,
So takin' you off into the galaxy
Is Vicious, Vicious, VICIOUS LEE!

Song:   Stick Wit Her
Typed by: The_Mobb_Click@hotmail.com

Verse 1 *(Rame Royal)*

I let the dark metal bark wit no emotion
sharply focused
tearin through yo heart like a shark in the ocean
what gave you the notion that you could slow my hustle
take a share my business
I make you bear witness to this Oakland quarter sack vandall
runnin a quarter panell
an you can order that on any rap channel
wit enough ammo an a black flannel
to bury Rambo
writin plans fo my camary land flow.

Verse 2 *(B-Legit)*

I swang loose at night
Sav-el wit stripes
train in mist to be a killa
9-8 Vern Miller
fill it to the top wit the Aiwa duce
an no game niggas get the fuck cut loose
7-duce tonight
I roll one right
a vet on a set still trumped up tight
work streets at night
Supreme so clean
gettin money from the block like a slot machine.

Verse 3 *(Niki Scarfo)*

I turn the blocks to war zones
hin & juice fills my cantine
I'm at home when I blast chrome to keep the pressure on beam
murder scenes
he got hit when he crossed the grain
no time to explain
two in his brain, that's the game
fuck the fame
I want the fortune
the best place is outta town
the Vill was scorchin
years an years of drama
creeps, murder beef
seems niggas lost sleep over freaks caught up between the sheets.

Chorus *(Richie Rich)*

Niggas need the money and the muscle
picture that
a hog, a pimp, an two dogs wit no muzzles
in an everyday struggle
we had to hustle
my camp
stay amped about the stamp spender.
Chick getter
hard hitter
got a bitch in the club, Stick Wit Her
nigga, cuz if we get her
we gon' have it our way
hard times an connected wit the Bay.

Verse 4 *(Richie Rich)*

I'm screamin "Silence peeps"
come down them streets
4 point 4 pounds of blow is two ki's
sticky finger
hit each kick for 6 zips
slick nigga paintin my town in new whips
the coke bouncer
low number announcer
12 zones short nigga finna take him court
it's my click
I know they notice, we evict
we on some mo fuck a bitch, slang rock shit
check this.

Verse 5 *(Rame Royal)*

I slang a bomb of quarter back like Randall
drop back
caulk back the gat
blow out yo candle
to hot to hold
to hard to handle when I unload
still knockin jumbo
watchin for Columbo
rock it to the top of the pot like gumbo
paparazzi spot feds wit Royal to crumble
been breakin bread an tryin to count much more
makin big heads til my pockets look like Mount Rushmore.

Verse 6 *(Niki Scarfo)*

My games uphold
to push a Rolls puffin doe
while I'm seen sellin soda goes beyond golden flows
from the Vill to weight holders
weighed his vest down
an still got touched jumpin outta Range Rovers
5 g's to a soldier
and 5 after
fuck the feds
and he finally got a chapter
cuz juss the heat the streets be crucial
so believe when you face this killa the feelin mutual.

*(Chorus)* 1x

Verse 7 *(B-Legit)*

I gots 2 pits wit me an they tone the pimp
go hard
a nigga disregard that lip
pump it down in yo hole
the green in yo doe
got bitches movin shit out department stores
it's H-O-Z dedicated to work
like to pull on my colla when I pimp it work
if it's yo skirt
she choose ya lose
either that or the d-boy blues.
Biatch.

Verse 8 *(Richie Rich)*

Nigga refer to the hook see the clothes by the bitch
it's real shit
remember the muscle an same hustle
wants free hustle put yo mind at ease
smoke weed
a nigga do whatever he please
two dogs
one hog
an one pimp
pushin heir-ron, coke, ex an hemp
niggas got this game at a stand still
keep the land filled wit leaves of coke until my hands filled.

Show and prove

[Verse 1]
Yo,the underground rap veteran here to bring you
Cats the medicine to stop all the shit you've been peddlin
Ain't nothin' better when your pockets is phat
Niggas get up in the game and start changing they stacks
Without gats I can run in your spot
And take everything you got
Without bustin' a shot
Nothin' but the hotness
Nigga we got this
Your same old style is now soundin' monotenous
Close caption hold cats that's ready for action
I wouldn't give y'all the satisfaction
(Yo better get your crack or so 
Cause I can light to your ass when the track is old nigga)
I switch tones like I switch colognes 
And keep it bangin hard to your stereo headphones
It's Dick Swanson for the niggas that still ridin' the Johnson
hate cats harder than Zack Bronson
I'm from the coast where they cary the toast
And puttin clothes to your hair spittin' lyrics instead
Never in arrears ?? the cash 
you being pushed out the block still coming in last
I let it blast so you niggas can feel 
Fuck shady cats actin' like they cuttin' some deals
I tell you cats this I be swingin the fish
You know the beats still bang and the lyrics is crisp
Ey yo

[Chorus] 2X
We spit it
You cats better get with it
Nothin' but cash man we stay fresh minted
If niggas is laid out then Rasco did it
Find me at the spot with the gunz still hot

I came to expose these mediore flows
Niggas who talk trash on weak ass shows
Niggas that ride dicks of weak ass clicks
Niggas that get smashed for being in the mix
I stand alone you clone your shit
You ponder recash that don't even know shit
Puttin' you out there to make 'em cash
Blame yourself when your career don't last
Outta your class vast amidst four tips with blue prints
Of books with some raw ass hooks
Never ran with crooks, I use my brain
Dissin' the rowl instead of dissin' cocaine
Tryin' to explain, your click ain't sick
I'm ready to smack y'all with forty five licks
Right to the teeth i spit heat to the street for real
Still lookin' for the cash and a deal
Who's fault is that?It sounds like yours
Nothin' but rhymes that come straight from the pause
Settle the score but don't spit in our clothes
I'm fittin' somewhere between the highs and the lows
Blowing back to those that shattered that glass
You know it's for real cause your sister sold by the glass 
I tell you cats this I be swingin the fish
You know the beats still bang and the lyrics is crisp
Ey yo

[Chorus] 2X

Ey check this
I ain't even begin I still blow a niggas plan turn water to sand
Every blade is plain I rain on a niggas parade
throwin' grenades at his fresh cut dane
Every joint is made on rhymes from the spot
You fuckin' with us you better bring all you got
Ras came to rock for real mc's
And fuck keepin' it real, I need those G's
One hundred degrees I burn outta turn so learn
Don't but here when you got no concern
Niggas get smacked for doin' shit like that
I verbally blast and pull his whole wig back
Straight from the CA we ain't no kids
You better rethink that and raise that bid
You know what it is rush the bus like us
Living this plush plush the trust is a must
Ready to crush these young cats to the map
And how do I get mines to sound so phat
We take time I scrutinise every line
You spendin' my cash you better find every dime
One more time I spit lyrics like these
The soul by the glass rock shows overseas
I tell you cats this I be swingin the fish
You know the beats still bang and the lyrics is crisp
Ey yo

NYC, word up

Verse 1: Prodigy, A.C.D.

M-O-B-B D-E-E-P, A.C.D. burn sometin
Let's get lifted, Queens is you wit me
Niggas' shifty, I turn around, a kid tried to hit me
I back him down wit the 50-50
It had to been the thug in me, ya tunnel bang and come and get me
The first five hundred bitches free
He kid with the god jewel and let all my gods come thru
Live niggas on this side of the bar, you get smacked, boo
and fucked too, shit on me? Well then, fuck you
Gone wit your high class ass if you want to
Outta state you be suckin me off and breakin off
Weed bitch stinks of stallion but my dick went soft
My Mobb got in lock wit Masterlock, het getcha locks picked
Run up in your spot, mask-n-glove shit
Queens niggas involved with thug shit, you get lumpded
Crank, we in the bathroom thumpin

To the three-time losers, alcohol abusers
Big money spenders and the Ebineezer Scroogers
Thugs holdin fort wit the sixteen shot Rugers
The CREAM that I redeem will bring a Lex and Landcruiser
Dominant chapter, assassinin' the obsolete
and my Mobb comes Deep to put the wind beneath your feet
My heart's harder than concrete, and nervous streets
be walked offbeat but still thugs carry heats
I get deeper than skin, paragraphs from within
Dear lord, my life is trife, please forgive for me sins
My kin stay my kin, ain't no room for extra friends
One love to my thugs up north in the pens
Be a prophet to raise, beat my speech on stage
Nemesis renegade, breakin down barricades
These days are gettin rough, 'nother brother handcuffed
Fallen victim to the gameis like style's corrupt

Chorus: 

My crime niggas livin - street life
Them Queen niggas livin - street life
My drug niggas livin - street life
My street niggas livin - street life
You thug niggas livin - street life
NYC livin - street life
My Mobb niggas livin - street life
What?

Verse 2: Havoc, A.C.D.

For every rhyme I write, reality bites
My clique keeps shit rolled too tight
Regulate and know the rule
I gets some insight plus info, do stickers with my kickos
My .44 will burn that ass like goin raw with nymphos
So protect your lifestyle, rock your vest
or get your teflon put to the motherfuckin test
State pen put on points, son you know
Stay on the low, got the back, oh-no-no
When I'm on a dough blow, got ta guard you now
Kid, you wanna get foul, so now I gotta put that ass back on profile
Change your character, you ain't got stamina
Nigga get that dough, I ain't mad at'cha
The Infamous handle business, gonna make mines
forever, son, kid you heard it thru the grapevine

To my royal thug commitees and outlaws that live the life of Frank Nitty
The big city mobster, the C-to-D ???? has made the
god unholy, skies forever watch me
The prophecy, another chapter, there's no stoppin me
Propagation, my life story is far from fiction
cos at one time, the .44 bullets took the world, bring sparks and friction
I anaylse this 'erb so I roll with trife characters
The hardest for the world to cap, and shiner like a 
full carat diamond with perfect designin
Philly's and 9 mili's and Coupe De Villey's forever reclinin
To the shoot, physicals in this paradox
The world is hot and my plot is to receive grands and yachts
Until then I be a trife individual, dwellin in these days
Scorch from the deeez plus the sun's rays
Dead President dreams and million dollar schemes
Killer Queens, the land of CREAM fiends
A.C.D. the world terrorist
Stainless Rugers for the intruders and my cipher's Infamous
Thru New York and worldwide, we penetrate your inside
*?Diamond did?* drama, son, and 9 clips so prepare fro heaven's ride

Chorus:

A.C.D. livin - street life
My ice niggas livin - street life
Them jewel rockin niggas livin - street life
Them crack niggas livin - street life
Them coke-sellin niggas livin - street life
Word, NYC livin - street life
My man L.E.S. livin - street life
The whole Queensbridge livin - street life
Word up son, we're livin - street life

KnowI'msayin? Word up, A.C.D., Mobb Deep in the motherfuckin....
Yo yo, uhhh
Hold me down, son (No doubt, son)
Back em down, son (I got'cha back, son)

Typed by: Byg_Balla

[Chorus]
Hey we bring this to the street
Cause they ain't seen us in the street
But they need this in the street
Cause it's mean up in the street
We're redemmed of the street
That used to clinge to the streets
Till we saw our thirst wasn't quenched
By the scene of the streets

[Verse One]
Hey, this ain't aimed at the church but you might be incouraged
This is for the folks hurt on the block with the word
See ya playing in the dirt, hoping you can get the bird
Steady sippin on your syrup, wit a dutch full of burb
Let me tell ya what's gon happen dawg, this is why I'm rappin dawg
You catch time for the crime and then ya trappin dawg
Oh what's worse, is it could be your hers
6 feet up in the dirt, got yo baby brother hurt
Yea, a worse still when you die, gets real
You eternally separated from God for a trillian
Million, billion eternaty mayne
Ain't no number for it, this should be concerning ya mayne
Look, ya can't sleep cause ya sin so heavy
Ya sweating in ya sheets cause ya sin so heavy
Ready to die, naw, dawg, you ain't ready
You don't truely know what's on the other side young revin
Is sin equals death, so turn from your mess, believe and confess
Christ is God in the flesh, he died for your debt, he did resurrect
A tool and a vest won't really save you from death

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
They never saw us coming, they had they heads turned
We faced the persecution, we know the led burns
We know them nails hurt, we know them thorns scared
We know our futures bright, but it ain't in the stars
We a new generation, who know the worlds hurts
And though we don't rock suits, we still part of the church
Our souls hurt too, our burdens hurt too
We want the Lord to be gloryfied on the earth too
We wearing dickies, yeah, but we still know the bible
We yelling like David was, ready to start revival
I know some kids in Dallas still in Jr. High
They ain't tryin to pimp girls, push work, or get high
Yea they jeans hangin low, and they keep they hat cop
But they living by the word instead of living by the block
Gettin trained a disciple, they changed all they idols
From juves in the streets to the God of the bible

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
We done redemmed of the streets that used to clinge to the streets
Till we saw our thirst wasn't quenched by the scene of the streets
So we bring this to the street, they ain't seen us in the street
But they need this in the street, cause it's mean up in the street
Chasin cream up in the street, servin feinds up in the street
And the scream that they see makes them feind what they see
To be the man of the street, that's why we stand in the street
To tell the whole world about the stand of the peace
The god man of the street, slian lamb for the street
That came and died for all the sinfull people in the street
Through him the cycle of the street when man rival in the street
Could be revival in the street, take the bible to the street
Cause his bride should be the street, stop trying to be discret
Why you lunging men and women steady dying in the street
So we pray up in the street, man we stay up in the street
Cause we find our God heart, man it pains for the street

Chorus: Chag G
Still, I wanna be
Right here in my hood
Still, I wanna be
In the streets, sippin' cognac
Still, I wanna be
In my (???), killin' (???)
Still, I wanna be
In the streets, yeah

[Mr. Lil' One]
(Verse 1)
I keep it moving while we groovin' in the sunshine
Give it to me, let me hear it just one time
To my mother and my brother up in heaven now
It took a little bit, it's better, cause I'm ready now
To the homies, doing time, and I mean everyone
Seperated from their ladies and their little ones
To our mothers in the ghetto, did the best they could
Kinda hard, without a daughter in the neighborhood
But we made it through the good and through the bad, too
Through the trouble and the struggles, see we had to
To the homies with the Khakis and the Pennotins
To their young'n's, to their G's, to the veterans
Through the drama, without mama and it never ends
To the letter for the homies that I'm 'bout to send
To the homies with the lolo's and the hydros
To the all, to the pen, to the barrios

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 2)
Tell the mamis and the daddies with their babies
I know it's hard and they may seem a little crazy
To my ladies with their babies by their lonesone
Your little baby will, one day, will be a grown son
And it's harder in the night, but then the light come
You made a choice, baby girl, and it's right one
And to my people with this struggle, tryna cope here...
We're living in the dark, but there's hope there
To the ghettos of the world, we gotta keep strong
Gotta fight to keep it right and try to shake wrong
Let me hear it for the people in the back, too
To my little baby girls, daddy thanks you

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 3)
And to the homies in the back with the cold one
All the homies with the sack, going broke one
See, we do it cause we love it, and it's like that
If you coming, then you barking, then we bite back
To the homies playing ball on a Sunday
To the homies where the L may be one day
To the young'n's in the hood with the hoodies on
Little mamis at the party, get their cuties on
Tell the ones that never made it, how we miss you
How we swig, how we trip and reminisce you
To the G's on the blocks, steady, fresh out
To my homie, Dan, I'm waiting til he gets out
I'm a leave ya to the men, and I'm a roll now
I been doing it for ten, time to blow now
So I leave you with my love and all the peace sign
From the west, to the south, to the east side

Repeat chorus

[Tha Realest]
Wassup, it's Tha Realest
Sendin this out to my big homey Pac
Lettin the world know that even though I plans on puttin heat down
got to lay it for a little while homey
Huh, it's still goin down
Still ridin
And even before ya went on ya little mission
ya left your little homey your blessins
So now I can't do nothin but stand strong

I pray for better days, laid in alleyways
Asked the Lord to help me thru these hard days
I cursed the world in tongues, I guess thy will'll be done
I'm tryin it til the day that I'm gone, can you see me smilin?
Hopin I got my life straight, I can't wait
to meet my saviour at them pearly gates, can't you see me?
My thug style brought me fortune and fame
Didn't deserve to get treated the way I did, baby feel my pain
False accusations make the whole world listen
Stand at ease but please pay attention, all I know
one day, homey that I'ma make it, hard times
but believe me homey I can take it, now stand strong
Jail time gave me a strong mind
Collect my thoughts to help me past my time, ain't no time to cry
Understand this is the way I was raised
That's how it is until the day I touch the grave, now stand strong

[Jewell & Danny Boy]
I feel the happiness
I see the pain, heyehey
You just gotta stand strong
	Youoouaaah
	Whoaaaoawhoa
You just gotta stand strong

[Tha Realest]
Now as the sunshine hits my face I'm thinkin I shouldnt've caught the case 
Fast times, the wrong place, now call my lawyer
Tell him, that I need his help and understand
I'm goin for broke so what's left? Call it suicide
Gang ties left me forever scarred
What can I say cos homey times were hard, now bless your soul
We turned on some of the wrong streets
but we were only tryin to make our ends meet, now that we made it
Can't understand the attitudes
The way you were bein treated baby, that shit is rude
Now keep your head up and don't forget to stay in touch
and take ya time to learn this game baby and don't rush
Raise your seed to be a strong man
Because his momma did the best that she can, so ya gotta love her
There's so many to blame when things are wrong
but keep your head up baby and stand strong, heyyyy

[Jewell & Danny Boy]
You got to, you got to
You got, you got, hey hey
You just gotta stand strong
	You, you you you, gotta
	Staaaand, oohyeaheyeah
You just gotta stand strong

[Tha Realest]
Memories that I can never forget, Lord
these handcuffs tightly bruise my wrists and that's no bullshit
See me makin the best out of these situations
So many have died from too much conversation
Inside my heart believe my spirits stand strong
Already knowin that I won't live long, heyyyy
Call me a sacrifice to the world, let me live
and Lord please bless my baby girl
Sometimes I wonder what the hell I coulda been
but I got sidetracked from too much fuckin seein, when will it ever end?
Tell me the secrets to these lost ass questions
Drawin my pistol for motherfuckin protection, now stand strong

[Jewell & Danny Boy, (Tha Realest)]
You, you	(I knew you gon' make it)
You got to, you got to, hoo     (To all the ones that love to stand strong)
You just gotta stand strong  (All the homeys that I lost stand strong)

				         Arsher Nate my homey)
You gotta    (Miss Defushias stand strong
	       God bless the child that can hold his own)
	You gotta stand, you gotta stand strong
When, when will your friends turn their backs on you?  (Haha, we'll just

You gotta stand up and be strong
	Will the chain let go of your heart?
	Let go, let go, let go
	You gotta stand, you gotta stand, you gotta stand strong
Take it from me, it gets so hard some times

[Verse 1: Pretty Ugly]
It started when the hotshots went past my spot
Police used to knockin for blocks, it had me wantin to clock
The one day I got proposition, they had me trippin
I put my man onto what I was gettin and where we flippin
I dogged two pairs of sneaks in the first week
I couldn't sleep, cuz I was afraid to miss a beat
Now my phase done passed and I'm in the game deep
The smokers love me, watch for the cops and my peeps
My mom kinda new, and so did the law too
Respect was due, so I chill when they come through
I calm down my crew, put a skirt on the brew
I always miss my curfew but what the fuck would you do?
With 5000 a night, off each G I made a tre'
The block was warm as May and gettin hotter every day
With no dues to pay, wasn't a way I could lose
But my last week of school my ol' head was on the news

[Hook] - 2X
In order to eat, you gon' struggle
I ain't gon' lie
While you eat you gon' struggle
Don't ask me why
Life is all a struggle then you die, yeah
Is it fair? Nah - Does life care? Nah

[Verse 2: Pretty Ugly]
Now I'm back where I started, couple grand and a stash
Wrote my man down what happened, told him watch his ass
After this court case pass, we gon' try it again
Until then I made friends with a pad and a pen
I wrote about current affairs and issues I was havin
All the coke I was baggin and all the pussy I was taggin
Every rhyme gave me the chills, cuz everything I wrote was real
Now who the fuck thought I'd get me a deal?
I grew up in Philadel, 2-3 to 4-6
It's survival of the fit, I'd flip a brick and get rich
But rough times danced along, but money was the song
But I couldn't get it on, cuz my ol' head was gone
I went to visit him, he said paper stay strong
Watch my new born, I'ma be here real long
But I gotta get mine, he said, "Naw get signed"
Didn't know I was livin live, till I had a decent time

[Hook] - 2X

[Verse 3: Pretty Ugly]
Now two years done passed, I came home with to cash
Tried to catch up with the past but the streets is movin fast
I had homies, but they left me lonely
Either they fell for a case, or they fell for a tenderonie
I was stuck in between a dream and a drug scene
Wasn't born with mean but I learned how to D
I lace a lot, five times a day non-stop
But I miss huggin the block and spendin a knot
Money was callin, felt myself Riq' I was fallin
I started robbin, cuz I couldn't stand starvin
And then I got shot two times in two spots
I almost went in shock because the blood wouldn't stop
I ain't gon' lie, I ain't ready to die
I ain't ready to fry, but I'm ready to ride
Some flip bricks and get rich, some stay broke and flip burgers
I'm gon' get further, write murder or get murdered

[Hook] - 2X

Aye.. P.U., High & Mighty
You know, Philadel, still reign supreme
Know who y'all heard ya first gangsta rap from
We started all this, it's our turn
Aye...

No similarity clarity and variety 
Pummeling perpetrators the rebel against society
Won't pause in my cause to battle rappers with floss
Like Wolverine diggin' deep in your skin with lyrical claws
Inflicting sores drop your drawers and get down on all fours
Wars, indeclared I'm fully stocked and prepared
Not scarred cause I'm ready to rip with Rock Steady
Raping pillage on village and set warriors on fire
Then mangling mercenaries victorious versifier
I'm sick, vomit various vicious verses violently
The war cheif I carry a battle axe and walk silently
Then strike with vengence lock horns and dominate
Don't try to flight the inescapable forces of frightning ?
Innovative western natives combine and infiltrate

Hook:
We take pride in the side where the sun sets nightly
Innovative creative western natives that rap tightly (x2)

Have you ever had to stand alone in the middle of a dope epitome
And nobodys got the remedy, everybodies your enemy
And you're thinkin to yourself you might be deader than a Kennedy
It's time to send in the Sentinals and Centries
Cause wedding bells and church chimes
Will shatter this whole century
Brain authenticity must you mind matter, 10 K.M. proximity
I'm extremely sorry that you're extremely sorry
Things have gotten out of hand and gone extremely awry
You ornery little varment  
Keep your hands off the kings cloth and garment
All my mics are laced with flame retarded
I'm a flamable freestyler and a fire fighter writer
The Bic in your Bic lighter, the web spinning spider
The number one Silver Surfer MC's please let's make a merger
Before you get murdered

Hook

Might be the writing fighting exciting life
that we lead that's inviting
Biting definatly catchy throw rappers on a hauatchy
No matching I might break is the recital title takers
The friendly sky flyer the hectic electrifier
Two crowns the energetic genetic intensifier
Now enter the lion's den pumpin' iron aggressivly
Gettin' bent on a back road succulent secret recipes
Fuck you then try to mess with me
Preps controlling the drivers seat 
In the back trench pench kissing teen queens saliva sweet
Privacy minamal breast caress the princess 
Calls me her knight in shining armor saving damsels in distress
Adventorous sentous spacious malicious gracious
The final frontier for pioneers

Wh... what do you mean what was my childhood like?
What difference does that make?
My childhood was messed up, so what?
Everybody's childhood is messed up
This is the nineties.
You find me one person that had it right
What does that got to do with me rhymin'?
What's left?

Now when my mother died, I had to take it in stride
There ain't room for pride in watching your father cry
And dad made it until maybe a year later
When they found his suicide inside of a grain elevator
Got over it, I had no other opposites or options
Thought about whether or not mom and pop was watching
Never bothered for caution, no time for fear
So my folks care-free for most my early years
And I learned from it, turned nuhhhhh! so many corners
Storm my burning sun waiting for the world to plumb it
Finished growing up under my uncle's roof,
He taught me how to count, all the way up to 100 proof.
>From watching him, I learned how to gather nurishiment
Living off from different women that he had to nurture him
And on the surface I became a normal free teen
More afraid of nuclear war then state my TV stinks
My best friend was my TV, gameshows and cartoons
Subsituted for puppies rainbows and balloons
Now here I am, the shy type
And I think I'm doing all right
Considering what it was like within my life

It's all sunshine, It's nothing but sunshine
It's all sunshine, It's nothing but sunshine
It's nothing but sunshine...

Now it's been 17 summers since I've seen my mother
But every night I see her smile inside my dreams
When I was younger, I didn't actually see the accident happen
But every night I see her smile as if a shadow's against the screens
I can only imagine Dad's internal reaction
Straint, infernal burning baloney his brain
Once it takes to make the man that owns achres of land
Abandon the family plan, he drowns himself in his grains

I'm glad I left that farm in northern Minnesota
Where the time moves slower and the winters are colder
Became a city boy where everybody acts like they hold off
Where they stick to themselves and keep a chip on his shoulder

26 years of age, no longer full of rage
I think it's safe to say that I turned the page of my childhood days

Look Ma! I'm a productive member of society!!
When I'm drunk I make noise, but otherwise I live quietly
And on the weekend I go back up north to reminisce
Remember what it was like pretending to be a kid
Late at night I walk the fields, and lurk in the shadows
to get even with life by murdering cattle

MUHHHHHHHHH... MUHHHHHHHHH...
"Come here, yeah! Come here! Yeah! Yeah!! Uhhhh....
 I got sunshiiiiiiiine...  on a clouddddddy dayyyyyyy...
 when it's cold outsiddddddde... I got a month in Mayyy..."

It's all sunshine, It's nothing but sunshine
It's all sunshine, It's nothing but sunshine
(and I'm gonna be alright, you're gonna be alright
you ain't gotta hold my hand, just walk with me tonight...)
It's nothing but sunshine!
It's nothing but sunshine!!

and I'm gonna be alright
You're gonna be alright
You ain't gotta hold my hand
Just walk with me tonight...

Song:   Adventures of Super Rhymes
Typed by: jostmatt@bluewin.ch

* originally Adventures of Super Rhymes 12"

Rhymes faster than a speeding bullet
Has more rhymes than a train has tracks
Able to leap sucker MC's in a single rhyme
Look, at the jam, on the mike
(It's a bird!)
(It's a plane!)
No
I'm Su-
Su-
Super Rhymes
(Rhymes)
(Rhymes)
(Rhymes)...

It's the new thing, makes you wanna swing
While us MC's rap, doin our thing
It's not singin, like it used to be
No, it's rappin to the rhythm of the sure shot beat
It goes one for the money, two for the show
You got my beat, now here I go
You see, this DJ, he gets down
Mixing records while they go round
With the hiddip, the hop, ya just don't stop
You rock to the beat till it makes you drop

Yes, I'm one of a kind, I'm Super Rhymes
And I'd like to say hello
And since I'm on the mic and I'm ready to rock
This is how it goes
Yes, I rock so good, I rock so well
I ring-ding-ding-ding-ding-a-dang
Baby, I'll ring your bell
Yes, I'm Super Rhymes, I'm 22
I'm gonna be 100 before I'm through
Because no, I didn't come from the planet Earth
Planet Rhymeon is my place of birth
>From the day I came out my mother's womb
I found myself in the operating room
Then the doctor spanked me on my behind
I didn't cry, the kid started to rhyme
My mother said, "Son, that's the way it should be
Your name is Super Rhymes, you'll be an MC"
So then my father put me on a meteorite
Sent me to Earth to rock the mike
I got to Earth and started layin it down
At the jam, on the mike, I could be found
While I was at the jam this one time
Rockin to the beat, said I'm feelin fine
Just freakin out on a freak's behind
I looked in the face of Frankenstein
I said, "No, no, she's not mine"
Because my woman is fine as wine
And she goes by the name of Louis Line
But she didn't come here with me this time
I'm feeling real sad, but not that bad
I'ma have to run away from this crowdad
I ran to the deejay to rock the mike
He said, "Super Rhymes, take it, do what you like"
So I rocked the party viciously
This guy I didn't know, walked up to me
But the closer he got, the more I could tell
It was the man they call Howard Cosell
The guy you'd see on KBC
While Joe Frazier boxed Muhammad Ali
He said, "Excuse me, sir, are you Super Rhymes?
The one with the fine woman Louis Line?"
I said, "I am, will I be on TV?
Like to float like a butterlfy stingin Ali
He said, "Yes, my man, if you show me you can
I was told you had the masterplan"
So I rocked the mike for Howard Cosell
To show America how I rocked so well
And while I rocked the mike, this is what I said
About Dracula, the living dead
He didn't like blood, not this vampire
The disco beat was his desire
Transylvania's where he made home
Until one day he decided to roam
And then out of the crib he did crawl
Count Dracula is what he's called
He said, "The sun's gone down, and now it's night
I'm goin to spread my wings and take a serious flight
I turned into a bat, I flew away
I said at the disco is where I gotta stay
Because back home, there was nothing like this
In Transylvania this is what I'd miss
They just bite necks and suck blood all day
But I know there had to be a better way
I parked my car, sun set, "Vampires, I am leaving"
So I turned into a bat and cut out that evening
The first disco I hit was 54
They didn't even want to let me in the door
I said, "Listen, my man, I am a real cool guy
I can turn into a bat, I can even fly"
He said, "Dracula, you can do all of that
Then come on in and catch a neat freak attack"
So I went inside and I started to dance
And had all the ladies waitin for their chance
They said, "Isn't he cool with his widow's peak"
And the strange way he does the Freak
He said, "Where I come from it's not called the 'Freak'
It's the Transylvanian Boogie, seven days a week"
I didn't get to dance with them all that night
Cause at the break of dawn I saw sunlight
I said, "I'm sorry to say I cannot stay"
Cause us vampires must be in before it turns day
But don't forget, I'll be back
I like it when I catch a neat freak attack
And since you heard my story, it's time I be leaving
In Transylvania we say "good evening"
Mr. Cosell said, "Damn, that's good
You'll be on TV in every neighborhood"
He said, "Super Rhymes, you're a real MC
We must put you on KBC"
I said, "I'll dress to impress, won't claim I'm best
I'll come a little better than all the rest"
Because I never come with any less
Than all the rhymes that will pass the test
Because I'm cool as ice, I'm twice as nice
I never had an off-day in my life
You see, I take all your money, bust out your wife
Make you dance to my beat all your life
Cause when I get in my stuff and I start to rhyme
The sucker MC's hide everytime
Because my voice is baritone
And I really don't need no microphone
But I use one anyway
To make sure the ladies hear what I say
And from here to there they hear my voice
The ladies hear me, I am their choice
Because my hair's more wavy than there's ships in the Navy
And they use a boat to stay afloat
To put hickeys all over my throat
Because I am SO COOOOOOOL...

Because I'm cool as snow, I'm like savoir-faire
I'm the man you can't find anywhere
Because I'm cooler than cold, I'm hotter than heat
I rock to the rhythm of the funky beat
Because I got what it takes
To make everybody wanna break
You see I gotta what it take
I take it, make you wanna break
Breaker 1 (breaker 1) breaker 2 (breaker 2)
I say this is what I wanna say to all of you
Go and telephone, or tell a friend
The man known as Super Rhymes is back again
And all you fly guys, I tell you this
I take your fly girls with one kiss
Because I take the fly girls, put em in check
I got my love potion all around they neck
They've heard my voice and they know my name
They know within me there burns a flame
That I'm MC man, headed straight for fame
I got a Coupe DeVille, diamond rings
I even got fur coats and gold plate things
Cause I'm the man of the hour, too sweet to be sour
The ladies know I'm the man with the power
And now that you know a little more about me
This is how I rocked KBC
You see, deep in the desert, the city Bagdhad
Aladdin was the boy, a magic lamp he had
Aladdin was to rub it and soon find out
That the lamp had magic and a genie, no doubt
He rubbed the lamp, a genie appeared
But you really couldn't see him till the green smoke cleared
Well, the smoke was gone, and there he stood
The tallest damn cat in the neighborhood
He said, "Where I come from I committed a crime
For every little thing you must serve time
But if my lamp was rubbed I'd be set free
But otherwise within the lamp I stay eternally
And Aladdin, I say thanks to you
You rubbed my lamp, now my sentence is through
And Aladdin, your wish is my command
I'm sorry, but you only get three, my man"
He said, "Genie, my first wish would be
To go to the year 1980"
"Hocus pocus," said the genie, "I'll do that"
Aladdin looked around, saw where he was at
He said, "Damn, things aren't the same
I wonder if Aladdin is still my name
But it's nice to be in '80
And I gotta say thanks to you, genie"
He said, "There's nothin to it, I used to do it just about everyday
Until I went to court, I got put in the lamp and the judge to take the spell away
But then you came along, made right my wrong
You rubbed my lamp and you set me free"
He said, "You used one wish, and you got two left
Aladdin, tell me what's it gonna be?"
He said, "Genie, in this society
You must have the green stuff called money"
So "hocus pocus" said the genie, "here's a million bucks
You take it all with you, here's an armored truck"
"Thanks," said Aladdin, "Genie, you're a real champ
But for a little while get back in your lamp"
The genie said, "Aladdin, yes, I'll do that
But you got another wish, now I'll be back"
So with a puff and smoke the genie was gone
Aladdin said, "A new millionaire is born"
Well, with all that money he made more money, Aladdin was doin swell
You see, my man Aladdin he got smart, you see, invested money into an oil well
But then one day he said, "I'm tired of makin the desert scene"
He said, "I gotta get away, I gotta go to the disco, find the freak of my dream"
So he took control of his private jet
His magic lamp and money he could not forget
Yes, he got to the disco, danced and screamed
But still couldn't find the freak of his dream
But then she came, through the door
The baddest freak Aladdin said he ever saw
He said, "Wow! I gotta get that girl!
Her love is worth everything in the world"
She was a 38-24-35
Aladdin was attracted like a bee to a hive
Aladdin walked up, said, "Hello"
She looked him up and down and said, "You know where you can go"
He said, "Come on, baby, don't play no game
I'm called Aladdin, tell me what's your name?"
Well, out of all the things Aladdin tried
She said, "Listen, sucker, take a carpet ride"
Aladdin said, "I know what to do
I call on my genie with a spell for you
So then he rubbed the lamp, the genie came back out
The genie said, "Aladdin, what you're fussin about"
He said, "Genie, I rocked, I said I'd be her man
I tried to do it to her cause I thought I can
It was then that I met this girl
Who said she wouldn't freak me for nothin in the world"
Out of all the things that Aladdin thought
She stole him a body, just couldn't be bought
So Aladdin said 450
I know you're comin to this bank with me
But the freak told him no
And my main man Aladdin, he told her so
He said, "I grab my partner do-si-do
I spank her to the beat, but don't let go
Until I hear her holler 'yo, yo'"
To the beat, beat, check it out
The genie said, "Aladdin, I agree
This freak has got a vicious body
But that wish will be your last one
After I do, my job is done"
The genie said, "Your wish is my command
She'll be your girl, you'll be her man
So he crossed his arms, said a magic word
A 'hocus pocus' is what you heard
He said, "Aladdin, she belongs to you
Take her home and do what you wanna do
But now it's time that I leave
I pull my magic carpet down out my sleeve
I'm gonna climb aboard, I'm gonna fly away
Back to Bagdhad, that's where I'll stay"
So Aladdin looked up, said goodbye
He watched the magic carpet and the genie fly
Now this is the end of this little tale
It's time I keep rockin, the genie's out of jail
So when I say 'rock', you say 'roll'
When I say 'ice', then you say 'cold'
Then when I say 'disco', you say 'the beat'
I say 'it's like honey', then you say 'it's sweet'
I say rock - roll
Say ice - cold
Say disco - the beat
Like honey - it's sweet
Now you know my name, you know my game
Compared to me there's none the same
Because I got a funky groove, I'm gonna make your body move
Because I gotta what it take
I take it, make you wanna break
Breaker 1 (breaker 1) breaker 2 (breaker 2)
I said you heard my jam, now catch the boogaloo flu
Cause I'm Super Ryhmes with disco
I rock from here to Frisco
I make you hate your video
While I rock your mind in stereo
So kick off your shoes, relax your feet
You're gonna move to my beat, it sound so sweet
Because it's all of you I do adore
And I got so much and more in store
Cause all through the day, through the night
I sit down and new rhymes I write
Because this deejay, he gets down
Mixing records while they go round
With the hiddip, the hop, you just don't stop
You bop to the beat till it makes your drop
Because I rock so good, I rock so well
I ring-a-ding-dang-a-ding-ding-dong
Baby, I ring your bell
Because I ROCK and ROLL
In STERE-ERE-O
I ROCK and ROLL
In STERE-ERE-O
Like Fred Flintstone, said, a-yabadabado
You hear my jam, wanna yell it too
Because I got more rhymes than a clock chimes
I got more rhymes than a monkey climbs
I got more rhymes than a lemon in limes
And I got more rhymes than a bank got dimes
So freak it to the east, freak it to the west
I freak it to the girl with the biggest chest
Freak it to the west, then you freak it to the east
But you never freak out with an ugly beast
So young ladies in the '80s
Come and ride in my Mercedes
Cause the ladies see they all must stare
Because I got brown eyes and a wavy hair
I'm not so tall, but I'm not so short
And you young ladies are my favorite sport
So put your hand in the air and let me know you're out there
You put your hand in the air and let me know you're out there
Then scream: oh yeah (oh yeah) oh what? (oh yeah!)
Y'all, I'm leavin now, but I'll be back
To make the young ladies catch a neat freak attack
Yes, the time has come for me to leave the mike
But I'll be back with more of what you like
So - take a trip

Simón
De las calles de Los Angeles
El centro
Pico Unión
Pa' la raza.... Y pa' los nacos
-¿Qué onda?-
Ahí les va

Trucha! Ahí viene mi tropa, por tu área
Cuando venimos, Psycho, rezan "Ave María"
Todos se encerraron en casa, ya no salían
Y los que querían pedo, todos caían
Y los vatos que vienen, tienen veneno
Siempre nos joden, pueden comer pene
Quién quiere caerle y si se meten
Se pueden arreglar con el doble cuete
Entiendes? Yo tengo negocio, algo
Que toda la gente piensa ser bien sucio
Vendo mota... ssshhh, no le diga a nadie!
Estoy buscando nueva clientela por estas calles
Ayúdame, mueve producto y así te sale
Mota y feria, pero trabajo
Chale! Está peladita ese!
Este no sale
Ganando pesos sólo surtiéndole a tus carnales

[Chorus]
Psycho, loco, wyno, mariguano
Vendiendo mota para ganar feria
Surtiendo la mariguana
Vendiendo la mota buena
Psycho, loco, wyno, mariguano
Vendiendo mota para ganar feria
Surtiendo la mariguana
Vendiendo la mota buena

Vendo botitas de la yerba mala, pero está buena!
Para sacar el precio, tenemos un sistema:
Veinte bolas de gramo, sesenta, tres y medio
La cuarta sale a cien y la onza a cuatro y medio
Si quieren libra o más, no más nos juntas celillo
Y si dan problemas, usas este remedio:
Fierro, balas, entierro, está bravo el perro
En defensa propia, así es que no hay encierro
Mientras mantengas tu negocio limpio
No vas a tener que usar la cuarenta y cinco
Esté listo, súbele los precios al gringo
Paga tus impuestos y sigue califo al gringo
Un chingo de vatos te van a querer tumbar
Pónte trucha, sino te van a derrumbar

[Chorus]

Pa' mantener a mis tres hijas y a mi familia
Les busco por las calles, vendiéndoles la fina
Esa es mi chamba, el barrio es mi oficina
Búscame, márcame el beeper, por la línea
Entrego a muchos rumbos, sí, vale la pena
Recojo lana por toda la ciudad entera
Espera, no te preocupes, no va a haber guerra
No soy criminal tranzando balasera
No quiero quebrarme la cabeza en un trabajo
Por un cheque pequeño y siempre quedar abajo
Chale! En esto me quedo y no me muevo
Hasta que una rata me ponga el dedo

[Chorus]

[Female]     Hello
[Spitball]   Ay yo, put Simon on the line
[Simon Sez] Hello, who's this?
[Spitball]   This Spitball, what's going down tonight?
[Simon Sez] Same as every other night
             We're gonna find some freaks and swerve

[Verse 1: Simon Sez]
I always got ten or twenty beauty girls within my reach
I'm the chief lifeguard at your local nude beach
Wham bam on the sand, make you scream for more
I pull freaks like the Taj, pull bodies from the shore
Close the door
I'm here to up the ante
My mouth starts to water when eatable pannies
Get pushed in my face, I gotta take a taste
I do all my thinking below my waist
Chase
Virgin girls
Bad mama-jamas
I move fast like a Suzuki Kadana
Tie you up with your bandana
I like juicy cherries, you like big bananas
We're a match made in heaven, girl
You know I'm bigger than a Boeing Triple 7, so
Let's get naked, leave your high heels on
I get my groove on your futon, then move on

Chorus:
[Simon Sez]           Let's swerve
[Earthquake Institute] Swerve
[Simon Sez]           Come on girl, let's rock it
                       Swerve
[Earthquake Institute] Swerve
[Female]               You know I'm down, let's rock it

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 2: Spitball]
I'm not Grandmaster, but I Flash 'em hoes
By the window
Yellin', "There's a party over here"
Brush my teeth, gargle with beer
Wipe the kicks
Press my shirt, then it's time to swerve
And serve words in my nerves
So when I speak
Nerds convert to pervs
Overnight
This rapper loves to bite
Soft skinned women with bigger thighs
Than Earl Campbell
Don't change the dirty channel
Leavin' bedroom scents in shambles, when I mack
It's a gamble
Put ya money on this thug
Hey strippers
We can wrestle in the mud
On the first night
Do the rough lambada
My name's Spitball, not Erik Estrada
Can you dig?
We live for the gigs
And lickin' Asian chicks and Afro wigs

Repeat Chorus Twice: Spitball

(Verse 3)
[Simon Sez]
Here to stay, boys, thrills and Cirque Du Soleil
I watch X-rated Japanese anime
First prize at the Miss Teen USA
A date with Simon Sez, dinner and dancin'
Romancing, girl
I'll get you out your baby doll
With loud cat calls and lots of alcohol
I got it all
Crawl into my sheets
I'll rock you to sleep with my Latin beat
Keep
An extra girl on standby
She keeps her one way wide opened
So I can land my
Jumbo jet
Where it's hot and wet
I had hot sex with girls I barely met

[Spitball]
I'm the homie that can swerve, smack, dab ya to a wall
Get up
Then walk through a bar room brawl
And never fall
So follow my lead
And drink what I drink, I think I got what you need
For the night
We'll swerve left and right
Right into a Motel Six where my girlfriend's
Waitin'
With toys for the session
I give up a kiss, then undress

Repeat Chorus Twice: The Earthquake Institute

[Lucky Luciano]
(Verse 1)
Come one, come all, it's playa made, we do this here like everyday
Hypnotic bottles and tanguaray, fillet mignon stake on my plate
It's paradise for a young playa, my Johnny watch stay on glare
Got a swimming pool built upstairs, no baller blockin', it's lovely
I smell like money and talk shit, don't like my style, get off dick
And press stop, turn it off quick, cause 'round here, we ballin', bitch
And they grade me, strictly told me that I would nevermind me nothin' (Fat bitch)
Now who's taking Benji' callings on TV screens, God damnit, Lucky
Jet skis
Palm trees
DVD's, six CD's
Spendin' G's on diamond teeth, then hotel suites in Miami beach
Ha
Take a look at me, now
Bling, blaow, girl, you wild
Take off your clothes and get naked now, I pimp up pimpin' and say it proud
Open wide, give me brain, don't forget to give me my change
Pimp my shrimp, rub my feet
When you done, holla my name
Now get upstairs and take a bath, and shave ya legs and the coochie too
I'll be waitin', jammin' Screw, smokin' weed in my swimmin' pool

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 2)
I'm ballin' boy and lovin' it, all 'round my neck, got somethin' sick
It ain't my fault I fucked ya bitch, she cooked me food and served my dick
Left ya kids at her mama's house, then came, jumped on a baller log
No problem, mayne, can these ballers bop, come on, mayne, I'm off the lot
Chrome shine, grill blingin', candy paint and wood grain
TV screens and leather chairs like a living room, I fuckin' swear
Tryna steer, she saddled up and rolled the dome 'round the six-10 loop
Skeet, skeet, through the rubber, hot, I dropped her off, boy, I'm a fool
Zipped up my 'Sache jeans, then proceeded to hit the club
Hit the lot and turned heads, then got 'em all like what it does
Next, snap, when I walked in
Playa Made Mexican ballin'
Braided up with a diamond grin'
Crystal, Don P and a bottle of Hen'
In the V.I.P.
Gettin' gone
Look at these hoes all on my bone
Fuck puttin' nothin' but in my phone, just get in your car and follow me home
Two o'clock and the club's closed, but this party just began (Biotch!)
3 A.M. we at the crib, come off your clothes, went enterin'

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 3)
And I'm iced up
Lookin' clean, Lucky got the sun on his team
Big Franco on my bezle chain, get a close up of that pinky ring
You never seen no Mexican with blue diamonds on his teeth
And you never seen no Mexican talk a stripper out some jeans
Better up that ladder, try again, it's hard to reach my status
Ain't no chance at this cat ballin' off, I rather keep on laughin'
I be stackin' like no other, buster call me Master Yoda
I'm space age and I'm playa made, young famous Saviola
Creased jeans and new jays, somebody stole my Screw tape
You want this spot, but too late, I got this here and oooh, man
It feel good, I'm forever throwed, my Benzo two days old
Ten G's and I rock a show, wake up, then put on my Versachi robe
Ordering off of menus with a bunch of bubba price food on them
Floss in a brand new breezy and she sure look like she model
Ain't no dollars I can't call, you ain't got it, go on and walk
I'm two times to the left, three times to the right, then open up my ball

[Mad Child]
I've lost track of my body count
The amount is enormous
Dropped in sector four
Non-conformist intimidates
Eliminating all heads of state
The punishment is banishment
Tarnishing and vanishing
I'm runnin' shit
Titanic panicking
Manic depressant
Addicted to adolescence
At the end of the crescent
Dragon's eyes glow fluorescent
Second-guess and rest in peace
Get laced in radioactive waste that's released
Feast fit for a king
Then bring two servants
Words swervin' and curvin'
You'll get what you deservin'
It's urgent
Mad Child slice precise like a surgeon
Emergency exit's where you're headin'
Ha, forget it

[Hook (both)]
I'm your host to the roller coaster
Stick to your guns and cling to your holster
X2

[Prevail]
As MC's slowly slip into sleep
Without bailin' with their hands up
Their homeboys act like Casey and Finnegan
Now this tends to send trends of frenzy
In to forensics
And then medics get hit
Lips spread like books of Dianetics
I'm a credit to my field of study
I, I kneel to nobody
You'll be as lucky as Lucy-Ann
If you get a word in edgewise
When it comes to being word wise 
I've got an edge
And a worldwide urge 
To rock on more wax than Verve
I'm in a class of my own 
And still throw the great curve
The great curves of a poet 
Is to run short on ideas
Works twice like two-way mirrors
My advice might slice like shears

[Hook]
I'm your host to the roller coaster

[Mad Child]
The penalty is execution
Suffer consequences 
Intense as a prison riot
Barbed wire fences
Tenses, your Excellency senses
Assassins in the entrance
Disguised as my apprentice
Nonequivalent sibilance in every sentence
Send a message up by horse 
Back to the castle, through the forests
Over the hill with no hassle
Scrolls scripted in gold
Ancient enlightenment
Wizardry and wisdom
Expressive excitement
Handsome and lonesome
The brand new heaviest
Lunacy in unison
Magnificent specimen

[Prevail]
The pinpointed path 
Through the pit and the pendulum
Hypnotic gases still whirl
On the last curl of the wind mast
And narrows in 
With Apollo and Ottomans
To cause pestilence
And rid the prominence
Of so called dominance
He and I the most decadent
With a promise of providence
I'm adamant about your iris 
Seeing the style I use
When it's evident
I compile a charge 
Like an alkaline pile
The concubines of pantomimes
More war chants and streamlined design
In the line, ligaments
With imagined figments
The tragic and epidemic rise
Of zero point five micro-pigment
Can you dig it?

Harmony, unity
You and me, grew to be
Bigger than we thought we could 
Brought it up from the hood
Givin back, livin' Black
Our problems all good
Kept in the family
Keep it strong like we should
We can eat, who said we can't pity on that man
Every time I see you I see GOD y'all, family stand
(they don't know, no,no they don't me, they don't
know)

Yo
You and me
Together we
Pull together desperately
To make a change
And break the chains
You know the pain
So rake ya brain
This ain't no game 
This is life man
What's ya aim?
What's ya name?
Where you from? Where you goin?
Do you know that the more you know the less you
knowin?
Let's keep it growin
It's not the endin'
It's just beginin'
Regardless of the tricks they try we keep transcendin'
Keep ya pop jams spinnin'
Raise strong men and women
To higher forms of livin'
That we previously been in
Kings and Queens rev your engine
Get in position
Put down your superstitions
Religious divisions and listen
Ya baby's trynna talk to you
Ya mate is trynna walk with you
Ancestors die for you
Grandparents try for you
Evil do-ers lie to you
Can't say good-bye to truth
Man what you plan to do?
(Indeed)
Pray stay faithful things will come to you
However long it takes to penetrate and breakthrough
I'll meet you on the other side
Where there's love peace happiness and self pride
yeah
Bridge:
Powers in our hand
Feel me demand
A Universal stand
We slave on this land
Now the serpents king
We're gonna do our thing
Let that freedom ring
If you wit me people sing

Chorus:
Family stand, family stand, family stand, family stand
(repeat 1x)

Yo
We livin now
No waitin on the next life
Gotta use up every moments worth to make this one
right
We fight today to bring the youth to write tomorrow
Came too far down this road we unload all the sorrow
And stay busy
No harvest this great
Workers this few
We put ourselves inthis position gotta pull ourselves
through
If we fight towards our prayers, gotta fight for you
When we all fight together anything we can do
You know a war without casualties ain't no war
Many died to live before
There's gonna be more
They can beat, kill and rape us
Take us from our neighbors 
Seperate us from our family
But them cowards can't break us
Babylon falls prophecy like ?Tolstoy?
The boys become useless The system self-destroyed
Apocalypse now, and the Devil can't alloy
Cuz Heaven's in our hearts and we're gonna bring the
noise
From the mornin through the night
Through dark shine light
The prize clear in sight 
We dedicate our life
Givin everything we got
All our might for our rights
We get up, we stand up and don't stop the fight
Unite.

check, check

this is... this is.. this is..

youuuuuuuu
ya simply (gotta gotta gotta gotta..)
this is the most honest the hangar's ever gonna get.
you Gotta
youuuuuuuu
hangar 18 experience
ya simply (gotta gotta gotta gotta..)
hangar 18 experience
youuuuuuu
c'mon now

I can't take no chances
I can't fake no answers
To questions givin sievin nectar slippin seats so slanted
It's all so crooked look it looks upon the chess board dancin
Maybe my season of release has come and see me playin this
I'm plottin opera singin stop the swinging on these branches
You fuckin monkeys think you squirrels you know we're nuts bananas
You see my dreams they seem to gleam and glimmer +freeze and lanterns+
I can't believe these puzzle pieces have these +streetsly standards+
I clap for trees that sway in breezes +whistlers, where's those antlers+
They be like glancin with the patience of some prayin mantis
Those sink the subtle blow the bubble and we paint Atlantis
I grab my fan brush make my fans hush with my daily chantin
Whassup with me, whassup with you, whassup with supple banter
Whassup with couples laughing kings and queens we are the champions
Champaign glasses saw those booze and heart-shape bubble bassets
Too much to handle think the candle flick a sappy passion
But every happy got me thinkin back to prior sadness
My college roomate's mother passed three years way back from cancer
Invisible tears they trickled on his face he looked like phantoms
But I could fathom that 'cause ten years back my dad was that one
I wish that she knew that I was teachin college grad and Latin
Playin chess and caressin flesh upon some sultry satin
My words elixirs mix with sutures but his heart attacked him
I switched the bitch enriched the gift and started havin +mappin+
Life has sorta shitted on this ship where is the captain?
I got the coolest friends in every town we go out laughin
The next day grabbin aspirins hangar's over beat the caption
It's much bigger than this.. so I can't take no chances

[Chorus]
Chances I take gettin lost is an offer
the source is a awkward loss is a source
Of a chance not taken and the prophet is false
cause the answer is fake you ignore all the forks
Keep all the phases of life in the pages
will burn bright churn right into the liquids
Take all your visionary kids big thug war tactics
mix and you be the witness (WHAT!)

youuuu
ya simply (gotta gotta gotta gotta..)
youuuuuuuu
ya simply (gotta gotta gotta gotta..)
youuuuuuu
Gotta gotta gotta
c'mon now

youuuuu youuu  youuuu

I can't take no losses
No stalemates or forfeits
I made a choice to raise my voice towards all the hate that haunts us
They poltergeist I hold the mic no need for praise or worship
I only phrase my thoughts in ways that ought to paint a portrait
Sometimes it's fun sometimes it's NOT but I can't fake or force it
Sometimes my soul is freezing cold this world can make it frostbit
It wont defrost and it wont thaw because they feed me torture
My greedy boss it needs the sause man I can't bare these crosses [erruh!]
Sometimes I think I'm gonna snap because I'm trapped by forces
That want to rip me piece by piece like horses drawn and quartered
This fucking courtship has me cautious cause I'm feeling cornered
I got these bills I got this debt I'm like two steps from pauper
It makes me nauseous thinkin thoughts like this I can't ignore dem
I gotta bite and scrape and might escape a fate of boredom
That's why my eyes on the horizon trying to save a portion
Of every paycheck in your tape deck is our next recordin
Before you know it every show it's hangar 18 tourin
We'll live our dreams and hear the screams of all our fans adorin
And find a wife and build a life and have a son and daughter
And once I'm there I swear I won't care if I see my coffin
Not on some death wish just expressive when you hear me talkin
So when the pressure gets aggressive trying to change my courses
These goals for livin leave me driven like precision Porches
So to success, no time to rest, cause I can't take no losses

[Chorus]

[Skillz]
Alright, listen up
I'ma put it in perspective
I'm the best since me
I got a right to be selective
What we have here is a candle so crass
It came out the cup with some shit from yo ass
strictly for those who are tryin to walk it with me
Ya'll thinkin y'all thugs cuz you bought some Dickies
I'm bein honest, throwin back to the hottest
I got LeBron callin his mom to check his closet (WHOA)
the rest can chill, you shoulda knew that
Skillz, uh-uh, you don't wanna do that
Testin me? That must be a fool that
Was thinkin too hard, you better loosen your doo-rag
When I'm gone, ons y'all for frontin
Dont have my vocals sings shit like we was cool or somethin
Its a fact, I think all rap is whack
and if you feel like I feel, then you ain't got no choice
but to.

(Chorus - 2x)
Take it Back, do do do do
Take it Back, do do do do
Take it Back, do do do do
Take it Back


[Skillz]
I ain't here to make friends, that ain't my job
If everybody ain't nice, that ain't my squad
and I ain't hypin 'em, I'm blowin right by them
this is like a grown man ridin a bike again
It's that easy, when I spit for the hood
I dont rap (nope), I explain shit real good
Ya'll say y'all thugs?
Well last time I seen ya, you were Steppin in the Name of Love
like "Left, right, bring it back"
Nigga, what part of the game was that?
if you see us, then its a known fact
that y'all is lil boy flow, this is grown man rap
you a playa? well move with a limp folk
that ain't a pimp cup, thats a god damn Big Gulp
I'm your new A&R, Black
I'ma book some overtime, you write some more rhymes
and..

(Chorus - 2x)
Take it Back, do do do do
Take it Back, do do do do
Take it Back, do do do do
Take it Back

[Skillz]
When I charge the emcee, equals a bar a key
just me and the squad, no manners, no "pardon me"
so dont bother be trying to get father than me
if you ain't right now, you ain't workin harder than me
and I'm sure you'll flip, when this song come around
this shit so crunk it'd make Lil Jon clam down
hits out the trunk never shook
so by the time you get to the hook
you be whippin out your check book
lets look, or better yet, lets not
I talk shit to the sun, nigga I'm just that high
and in case y'all forgot, here's your warning B
cuz I snatch it like it rightfully belongs to be
and just..

(Chorus - 4x)
Take it Back do do do do
Take it Back do do do do
Take it Back do do do do
Take it Back

Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I don't know why I love you like I do
After all these changes that you put me through
You stole my money and my cigarettes
And I haven't seen hide nor hair of you yet

I wanna know
Won't you tell me
Am I in love to stay?
(Stay, stay, stay)

Take me to the river (take me to the river)
And wash me down (wash me down)
Won't you cleanse my soul (cleanse my soul)
Put my feet on the ground (put my feet on the ground)

I don't know why she treated me so bad
Look at all those things that we could have had
Love is a notion that I can't forget
My sweet sixteen I will never regret

I wanna know (I wanna know)
Won't you tell me
Am I in love to stay?
(Stay, stay, stay)

Take me to the river (take me to the river)
And wash me down (wash me down)
Won't you cleanse my soul (cleanse my soul)
Put my feet on the ground (put my feet on the ground)

Hold me, love me, please me, tease me
Till I can't, till I can't take no more

I don't know why I love you like I do
After all the things you put me through
The sixteen candles burning on my wall
Turning me into the biggest fool of them all

I wanna know (I wanna know)
Oh won't you tell me
Am I in love to stay?

Take me to the river (take me to the river)
And wash me down (wash me down)
Won't you cleanse my soul (cleanse my soul)
Put my feet on the ground (put my feet on the ground)

Take me to the river (take me to the river)
And wash me down (wash me down)
Won't you cleanse my soul (cleanse my soul)
Put my feet on the ground (put my feet on the ground)

Take me to the river (take me to the river)
(take me to the river, river
take me, take me, take me to the river)
Take me to the river (take me to the river)
(take me to the river, river
take me, take me, take me to the river)
Take me to the river (take me to the river)
(take me to the river, river
take me, take me, take me to the river)

Bitch I'm from the {?}, yo' hood ain't no realer
You the pussy ass nigga livin next to the killer
I'm the killer that moved out of the block
And head back to the hood, when I'm movin my rock
You can find me, on a dark road, dark clothes
Lle', in the console and God knows I make grip off blow
Shit - I could get rich off blows
My nation affiation pitch forks I've chose
What the fuck you gon' do? We bang back hammers
I'm a six point star, in a gray bandanna
I'd die for this, nigga you rhyme for this
Pussy I ride for this, and did time for this
That's why I'm convinced you fear, that I'm convicted
Until elevens in soaps, and some gangsta shit man
Guess who gorillas leave tats infragments
Two shots through your cabbage, and gas from Ca$h

[Chorus: Ca$his]
Pussy niggaz always talkin that shit
What you flaggin, who you bangin with? (I don't give a fuck)
You can live in the hood and shit
But remember who you bangin with (I don't give a fuck)
Pussy niggaz talkin all that shit
What you flaggin in your bangin whip? (I don't give a fuck)
You can live in the hood and shit
But remember who you bangin with (cause I don't give a fuck)

[Ca$his]
Tip our levels and scarce piece, a meal beast
We'll creep one deep, slump seat, dump heat
Niggaz scream "Fuck me" he lucky, when I blast it
I left respect enough for an open casket
Way to go Ca$his, boost up my ego
Let loose, out sunroof with my Eagle
Folk of the century, rollin with peoples
The omen the sequel, the more they will see you
Close kin, molotov close to no skin
His momma pretends that she doesn't, know him
I'm the reason, for the whole "Say No" slogan
Doped in folk and loc'ed if provokin
Got a brand new thing, with the scope in
Leave your family, with the wake for hostin
I'll collect enough snow, 'til my hands the Aspens
I'm the realest nigga 'round here, ask for Ca$his folk

[Chorus]

[Ca$his]
Loadin the cup folk, loadin it up tote
Hang fire up I, choke from the gun smoke
That's on the boss mayn, my Nina Ross came
Place gangbangers, into a coffin
This is renegades, Rick not really paid
Gave Ca$h pistols, now they milli sprayed
Full bricks of raw, nigga that's really weight
While my workers foldin, now that's really cake
Give it right back to 'em, watch it regenerate
I'm a degenerate black bandit, livin ape
Niggaz dig in they pockets like DJ's dig in crates
If you cuttin my profits, you gon' in to dish some cake
Heckler Koch and, glass and vodka
I'm the independent kingpin, cocaine Koch
Fo' thieve blow weed, plus sold O-Z
Niggaz never son me, I was born O.G. fo'

On a double
See the subtle difference is aint me I'm bold
Write my raps on high-letter pens go for gold
Coz me and you l yo we have both been told
That we don't flick the mold coz we stick with soul
That's the type of hit I like to make a mic a niggaz flight plus
To flip the scroll for every cat that hit the bull
Sit back, and open like a tuna can as soon Janet James hit the sto'

Typed by: compbuttons@hotmail.com

[Cougnut]
Chillin' on the dark reminiscin'
Thinkin' about my dogs on the wall that I'm missin'
Pour out some drink on the dark then I click
How could I forget my dogs died over stupid shit
I try not to think but then my brain goes snap
Vision gettin' blurry, hand reachin' for my gat
Nightmares and murder got me trippin' when I'm sleepin'
Evil thoughts of my dead dogs got my mind tweakin''
Wake up and I'm sweatin' from my head to my toes
Migraine headache, body shakin' with a bloody nose
Rush to the bathroom, grabbed some water take a taste
Look into the mirror see Johnny Hody's face
All these body visions that I'm seein' got me mad
Thinkin' about my brother gettin' zipped up in a body bag
Gotta get revenge cause if I died I know my homies would
Master P, tell me something good

[Master P]
Look, these fools better realize
That we ten thousand motherfuckin' bloody hounds deep
Always beware of the enemy
Even of those on ya block
We lose one dog, we gotta kill ten cats

[Cougnut]
Weeks and days fly by but I still cry
I still wonder why them hot dogs had to die
Like my dog in the fast lane startin' things
Maximization so P I know ya feel me man
Feel good nigga cause every dog got a day
So crack a forty and celebrate with yo HK
Cause niggas dyin' frontin' for a lil' fame
Gettin' ripped up in this bloody ass chess game
Life is different and I'm feelin' it as I get older
I play the cards, niggas dyin' on every corner
And that's a take to be bleedin' on a fuckin' table
Or even took up in a body bag with a label
So R.I.P. to my dogs in every hood
P dog, tell me something good

[Master P]
Man the game ain't even the same
But cha' got to pack the heat now
In case the guppies tryin' to swamp a nigga
Up in the swamp, know what I'm sayin'
I refuse to be turned into some motherfuckin' soap
And wipe between them niggas ass like a dog
Society ain't shit man, done turned me out to a killer
I'm not sayin' don't handle ya business
But just make sure you got a plan
Cause a dog ain't shit when he caged up fool
You feel me Cougnut

[Cougnut]
I know you wanna know why I rap like this
Ever since "Scandalous" the 'Nut been merciless
Not in my nature to express and confess
Some say I'm obsessed others say I'm straight possessed
I guess I'm kind of pumped hear me out before ya criticize
Songs I be writin' make motherfuckers realize
Time is gettin' short, listen to what I spit
Ya might learn some game that'll keep ya from gettin' ya head split
Niggas talkin' shit, the ones actin' like they bigger
Soft rappin' suckers, MC Hammer type niggas
I don't give a fuck about em' puttin' em' in check
Just like rotten inside, busters get no respect
This game is gettin' thicker by the minute if ya in it
Ya gotta stay true to the game just to win it
Other rappers come ghetto then they cross to that other level
Address folks like that, get they sucker free passes took
If dogs mashin' on that ass till ya comatose
Motherfuck a gang, Ill-Mannered Mafioso
Comin' from the Bay, Frisco side still mysterious
And when ya come to town, ask ya niggas man it's serious
Fools gettin' whipped on everyday cause I ain't havin' it
And if you get some way I'll see ya ass at the cabinet

Song:   Tell the Truth
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Tell the truth
Tell the truth
Tell the truth

Everyone, has a closet
In the night, they wear disguises
In the dark, they hide from the truth
In the end, they lie to you

One day the skeletons are gonna come out
One day the elephant in the room will make a sound
Watch out for lions and tigers and bears
It's bout to hit the fan, better beware

Tell the truth
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
Tell the truth

Tell her why you lied for no reason
They point fingers and bite the hand that feeds them
Help em Lord, for they know not what they do
Swear to God they know better than you

One day the skeletons are gonna come out
One day the elephant in the room will make a sound
Watch out for lions and tigers and bears
It's bout to hit the fan, better beware

Tell the truth
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
Tell the truth

The closest people to you, you can't trust
Your family hurts you more than your friend does
There ain't nowhere to hide, nowhere to go
You better watch the finger too damn close

Tell the truth
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
Tell the truth

Ay
I don't know what you want me to do, girl
But whatever it is
Let's believe I'm a do it

Chorus:
[Sativa]  Just keep it hot, baby
[Mr. Kee] I keep it hot, baby
[Sativa]  Just do ya thang, boy
[Mr. Kee] Oh, I do my thang, girl
[Sativa]  Don't let the party stop
[Mr. Kee] Nah, I ain't gon' let it stop
[Sativa]  Know what we drinking on
[Mr. Kee] Tequila body shots, body shots

Repeat Chorus

[Mr. Kee]
(Verse 1)
We hit the club on the late night
They know my name
Know my face, cause we stay tight
We V.I.P.
Poppin' bottles of expensive piss
Whatever happens here
Tonight, I'm a plead the fifth
I'm throwin' hundred dollar
Bills at the party
Our family circle's
Too close, for you to enter
More snakes on the agenda
Oh, they play my song
The crowd's going wild now (Ah)
They ask me questions
Like who, what, when and how
Don't even worry about it
We got the game sold
You out there freezing cause you found out the game was cold (Damn, it's cold)
We keep it hot whatever you like it or not
Where my whole entourage sippin' tequila body shots

Repeat Chorus Twice

(Verse 2)
Now I just
Thought it that my eyes closed
From liquid chronic berries
Flow is how I sip those
I hit up on it
Now, I'm grindin' with two Latin chicks
They asked a question
Have I ever seen two ladies kiss (Have you ever seen two ladies kiss?)
I played the roll and told 'em
"Nah, love to see it, though"
From V.I.P.
To the back of my vehicle
The temperature is gettin'
Hotter on the dance floor (It's gettin' hot)
Cause when it comes to doin'
Dirt, I'm a man whore
And now I'm feelin'
Out of breath from the aftershock
Let's go to givin'
Each other tequila body shots
You probably wouldn't
Believe it, unless you seen it, too
I grabbed 'em both
By the hand, and asked 'em what they wanted Mr. Kee to do

Repeat Chorus

[Mr. Kee]
Oh, you know I keep it hot
But all the females
It's time to get up and shake somethin' on this one

Break: Mr. Kee
Just keep it hot, just keep it hot
Just keep it hot, just keep it hot, baby
Just keep it hot, just keep it hot
Just keep it hot, baby
Just keep it hot, just keep it hot
I keep it hot, baby
Just keep it hot, baby
Just keep it hot, baby

[Mr. Kee]
Now what you got?

[Verse 3: Sativa (Mr. Kee in background)]
A thousand dollars in my Gucci purse (Like that?)
These bitches hatin' on
Sativa, but I seen worse (Oh, she seen worse)
Another round of alcohol
For my home cat (Another round, y'all)
They treating me just like
I signed up for the Mr. Kee, a heavyweight champ
That's how we do, when we slide through (Uh hun)
Don't think about the tight
Jeans, all dark blue
If you can get me on the
Floor, I'm a do my thang (Do ya thang, girl)
A lethal weapon
Don't be steppin' all up your way
If you can't give me
What I need, don't you trouble me (Uh uh)
I'm in the back
V.I.P., sippin' bubbly
You think you got a chance
To hit it, well, I think not (Ha ha)
My destination is the
Top, to a clock, last call to get them body shots (Last call)

Repeat Chorus Twice

Repeat Break
Artist: Killah Priest, Remedy, Heart
Album:  Wu Music Group presents Pollen: The Swarm, Pt. 3
Song:   Testimony
Typed by: Cno Evil

[Intro: Killah Priest w/ Heart adlibs]
Yeah... Supreme Hebrew Intellect, Rem-D
Killah Priest, Iron Shiek from the Middle East
A/K/A Masada, 'Lipps, let me feel you
This is the Testimony... The Testimony is here!
(*chorus starts here*)
As it is written, my life, love, uh-huh
The present, man, they taught me
Words of a tortured soul, it is the weather

[Chorus: Heart]
This is my.... this is my Testimony
Brought around, I feel his presence on me
The demons often told me, these problems often crossed me
And I, I, I...

[Killah Priest]
My poems, my cribs, my money, my wiz
My accounts, all the expenses, all my amounts
Means nothing, from my eyes, I've seen thy coming
I sleep when I dream, I see kingdoms crumbling
Ask my pastor, visit rabbies, even got baptized
Six times, on the sixth day
I sit and pray, Bibles, Torah, send 'em my way
This tortured filled with me rage, these loyals buildin' for days
Open up the graves, givin' hope for the slaves
Like the Shuyah, Tribes of Judah, my life's the future
The past is in my notepad, you read it like the forecast
Revolution: warpath, execution, I wore rags
My head up, I talk to the clouds
Lords of Laws, please walk with your child
Cuz if they try to kill me, bring the jury
And the whole court will come down
Fuck these pagans, workers for Satan
Disguised through your lies, came through poor education
The world's lookin' for a leader, he's the head of the nations
Read it in revelations, believe it, if you're weeded
They final destination, will be their devastation
I could just picture wings comin' out of our backs
Open up the flap, the whole sky turns black
The economy, collapse, and that's that, this is my testimony

[Chorus]

[Remedy]
Yo, I was made in the grounds, way beneath the streets
Wrapped up in Hebrew sheets, resurrected
Supreme Hebrew Intellect, what you expected?
I inject you, you've now been infected
In search of a rabbi, I found Killah Priest
Lakihim, merushuliam, you pray, facin' East
In a land, soaked sacred, rebel for common error
Blood, sweat, tears, terror
Lost souls, angels, the dead sea scrolls
Hidden in holes, barefooted, walkin' on coals
Behold, I'm at the lion's gate, controllin' my fate
This is I and don't hate, Heaven skies could wait
The most high, most try to get close by
This is it, Words to Live By, voices cry
Now or never, do or die, thou shall not tell a lie
I'm a fly, livin' that live, testify

[Chorus]

[O.C.]
Yo, unfold remarkable soul, cold-blooded
bleedin icicles, equivalent to North Pole
Roll El-Producto style, buddha mindstate
but I don't smoke weed to proceed, follow my lead
I Rock-well when Somebody's Watchin Me, rhymes fine
like Denzel, havin shorties all jockin me
My poetry paintin pictures, call me Picasso
Not so fast, put your microphone back in the stash
When I'm through foes with hoes, take what fits
You ain't worth what O.C. hold, dick made of gold
Soul controller, ruler of my dest', all eyes on me
like a pair of thirty-eight double-D's, rest assured
When I be on the mic, WAR, holdin the goods
like you buyin in the surplus store
You see I brought it down a notch so you could understand O
I'm smooth like a harp you, nothin but a banjo
So advance yo' tech-nine style, flipped off
Run into the likes of a Mongol slave
Fallout, the Gene-ral, be on command now
At the corner of the century, I'm the enchanted child
Fuck That abbreviated F.T., soon to come bust off
we bust back strapped ready for war

Chorus: Street Smartz

You when you hear this shit I bet your head'll swing
cause this a ghetto thing, where we pack metal thangz
just to settle thangz
(repeat 2X)

[Pharoahe Monch]
Get your motherfuckin orders of protection, MC's no question
See I was raised in the ill drug section
and that persuaded my poetical selections to be hardcore...
shit, I swore on my father's grave
I make slaves of niggaz who played brave
I craved to engrave my name inside of the pavement
and my basement's an arrangement of different torture devices
that slices, the first emcee who thinks they are the nicest
My advice is to you, think twice
The price to pay is your life, Jesus Christ I am the Pharoahe
The road I'm on is kind of narrow
Plus there's a fork in the shit and I don't know which way to go
But these scriptures are sculptures, to prove to dead rappers
Words hover above like vultures
I write the type of shit to make niggaz incite race riots
from the hate that white invited
Sinister, when it's the time to, finish the rhyme
watch the, minister climb up up, fillin in the atmosphere
like canibus and if it's activatin me believe I'm captivatin heat
plus I'm decapitatin three MC's with my axe like thoraxes
Practice allows me to receive information like faxes, what..

Chorus

[Street Smartz]
Niggaz you better watch your back
It takes concentration and confrontation
So fuck conversatin and contemplatin
Arms I'm brakin, spin a battle wild like a carousel
cause new MC's babble now especially when I have an L
These raps is meant to fear yo I'ma rip this sentence here
My comprehension scares to leave you in intensive care
Check my credentials, with pen and pencils, or instrumentals
I make your mental, experimental
Don't be actin cock-a-mamey cause niggaz on my block is crazy
Talkin that rap shit, you couldn't even rock a baby
Bitch I went out and bought a rifle (why?)
cause that's just more than trifle
I'm sorta psycho like a retard on a motorcycle
My mind changes when the time changes
An MC that ain't sayin shit might as well be rappin in sign language
I get darkened eyed, when I spark the lye
Start stompin guys, have em screamin, "Let's compromise!"
And love a fly brawl so why stall
Keep lookin at me I'ma spray some Lysol in your eyeball...

[Chorus: Jeremih]
I apologize, I don't recollect yo' name
(Ooh baby I don't know your name)
But lemme tell you that them heels, really compliments your frame
(Look at your body baby)
Girl lemme get them ooh aahs, then I gotta catch my plane
Say you miss me and you wishin for some private time
Girl how could we get that way?
Girl how could we get that way?

[Verse One: Wale]
Yeah~! Look, another day another dollar
She hate me when I leave cause when I leave I never call her
That's life shit, aight shit, I could call you right quick
But if I call you gon' be like "Boo why we haven't Skyped yet?"
And I Skype, bet you say "Lay where my flight at"
If I decline, then you inquire on where I spend my nights at
Shit, this life gets overwhelmin and more than hectic
But a woman worth some anger is certainly worth some effort
Just look closer, my life is quite deceptive
Women will sell they soul, just to buy some attention
I need somethin to hold, fuck that passive aggression
And when I'm back from off that road don't ask me no questions
Please.. fear what you don't know
Ha ha

[Chorus]

[Verse Two: Wale]
Uhh - don't remember how I met her, but I know I won't forget her
And if lovin her is wrong, then I just know I won't see heaven
She say she from Seattle, she 20 and some change
Before I get to T.I.A. I'm sure to make her rain
Then I'm back up on my plane, Chi-Town over here
We spend some time and get some wine, have some miles from heroins
I told her this here's overrated, but I love your city baby
Gotta get back to the D, you know we finally famous
Driver drop me off in Dallas, I'm headed to some money
TSA be laughing all them rubbers in your luggage
I know I'ma always leave 'em, but I swear I'll always love 'em
Tell her you'll probably find someone but you'll never find another
Parlay, aowww!

[Chorus]

[Verse Three: Rick Ross]
Got on my suede shoes, I'm in a great mood
That baggage claim awaitin miss thang outta St. Louis
Know she shinin bright, got on my Cartier
She my +Billie Jean+ we menage with mary jane
See we city hop, Vegas to L.A.
Brings a lot of joy, Bugati boy, that's lane on lane
Our faucets used to drip, I used to ride the bench
But it was written in cursive for this king to exist
Packed her bags, now she live amongst entrepreneurs
Marc Jacob the makeup Gi-Givenchy consumer
Gianni Versace connoisseur, a carnivore
Accountable for half a million uncounted for
For, ha! ("M-M-M-M-M-M-Maybach Music!")

Yeah ah ah Yeah Is ya with me
what up y'all forget me y'all love y'all don't love me no more it's all good
all are real roudy niggaz all my real niggaz ride with your boy one time

[Verse One: Ras Kass]
Lyrically I smoke who ever it may concern
Even wearing a twenty one milligram pack a nigga derm
Been broke before ain't nuttin new
But ain't nuttin ever new me not to say fuck you
So have my nuts not grew
I would still hang in the streets with little niggaz who is to bangish to eat
Bang with the heat the water proof spit blazes
To give y'all niggaz business like the yellow pages
Enter the dark ages, inteds, spark stages for what ever wages
Untill I am famous for resurection on hated language
And still the same shit different toilet
See the game ain't talented (unt uh) it's a battle scandle in it
And now them same clowns made at it (pimp game)
But go figure lyricsist of the year is a white boy
and greatest godfather is a huge nigga

[Chorus: Ras Kass]
And that's gangsta without bangin the set
Big nuts on debt ain't even hangin'em yet
See it's just some things they should never forget
Ain't no mother fucking west without a r-a-s
And that's gangsta without bangin the set
Big nuts on debt ain't even hangin'em yet
See it's just some things they should never forget
Ain't no mother fucking west without a r-a-s

[Verse Two: Ras Kass]
I was forced to rhyme undeniably and force niggaz to think
So if you need to dance so fucking much then buy N'Sync
Start a movement to move in motavation
of millimeter mantra repeat you need a monster
Me I be the aqua, "Waterproof" got a lot of truth
bitch slaughter a lot of groups
Rhyming without a clue, not off without loot
Black out like Caligula just a nigga that
clown with a sucidial groupie in the jacuzzi pullin my shorts down
Givin me underwater head 'til I nut and she drowned
How the fuck we sound (man rap is out of control I got to smoke son)
Yo homie bust me down
Took a pull of a new port and passed it back
Nuts hang like a had an elastic sack
Splash the gats if I find a classic clapse
Wanna know the reason why white people seem to laugh at blacks
Cause brothers in south africa slaving to death in diamond mines
Mean while we spending every penny to over shine
Tell the next nigga he lesser cause he can't afford to buy ice from his opresser
So I ain't pulling out nines willing the homicide need of mine
Mean while George W. Bush got a war on crime
(*matrix sample*)
Introduction to the matrix
I say the shit you know is true but you wanna ignore metanor metaphor

[Chorus: Ras Kass + Kurupt]
And that's gangsta without bangin the set
Big nuts on debt ain't even hangin'em yet
See it's just some things they should never forget
Ain't no mother fucking west without a r-a-s
And that's gangsta without bangin the set
Big nuts on debt ain't even hangin'em yet
See it's just some things they should never forget
Ain't no  west without kurupt with a r-a-s

Eryday (ha ha, ha ha, ha ha, ha ha)
Eryday
And I'ma live it through my music
(ha ha, ha ha, ha ha, ha ha)
You know how we do
Choose or lose from it

Verse One: Method Man

Pull your shoes up, don't get stuck
or get your frame struck, when my squad blitzin
hittin like Mack trucks, head splittin paper written
in windy cities like Chicago, no bullshhhh
You see me spittin at the kitten with the lost mitten
As we engage in cold war gettin frostbitten
Once again up in these stank drawers baby listen
One mind and for one cause, heavy hittin
The penalty illegal ruffnecks, we bring ruckus
in pursuit of gold lines, can a n---a touch it
If I can't see ya can't truss it
A shady character like Buzz Buzzard
Lay him out like a plush rug-ged
*mimicking Brand Nubian* Now you can love it, or leave it alone
We drink death and puff bone
Draggin your body out the end zone
And any way the wind blow that's where you flow
That's why you be the first one caught, last to know
Body layin out on the flo', substitute
Heavy players from the run and shoot, we open do'
Third and long, quarterback pack the cannon on
I go deep he drop bombs, *whistle* that's when I touch-down
Six points, what now?
Once again who comin through in the clutch now, perfect strangerous
Ever since I came with this, and wrecked a body
You convinced like Lombardi, that Johnny Dangerous
Offensive shotgun
Calm in the pocket I got one, in the milli gun
Deep threats to chose from, that's how it goes son
You win some you lose some, it's in the game

You win some you lose some (uhh!) that's how it goes son (yeah)
You win some you lose some (uhh!) it's in the game ... (yeah)
You win some you lose some, that's how it goes son
You win some you lose some, it's in the game

Verse Two: Ricky Watters

From the football field
(It's in the game
 You win some you lose some, it's in the game)
To the mountain, yaknowhatI'msayin?
(That's how it goes son, that's how it goes
 You win some you lose some, it's in the game)

Freestylin, profilin, won't catch me smilin
Straight from Fema Island, buckwhylin, I'm stylin
A funky type of style with the lyrical incision
S--t locked down, like my n----z out in prison
Good riddance, keep it hidden, up in my knapsack
Sippin cognac, while I vibe off this funky track
Yo bring it back, or make it hit harder
Infiltrate your mind like Nino at the Carter, but smarter
So drop harder, if you wanna conjugate
Verbs and nouns, make it profound as I pound
In your earpiece I'm the beast
To say the least, we must increase, the peace
But keep it real, so I can feel, the skills
Funky fresh rhymes I will build so I kill
and thrill, lyrics spittin, through my lips
Doin backflips, it's another hit
Come take a sip, of the running Watters
Lyrically I slaughter, mentally I author
the rhymes that you feel to the map
Crushin double barrels, sing em out like carols
Who it be?  It be I, the n---a with the chinky eyes
From NY, city we committee we gets busy
With killa beez on the swarm
Lyrically we storm, mentally a lord
Verbally I bomb (boom!), guard your grill
It's the man that chill, run for the hills from Grassvile
Drillin rhymes straight on tracks and double cuff
Another TV, and they loved it

(You win some you lose some, that's how it go son
 You win some you lose some, that's in the game
 You win some you lose some, that's how it go son
 You win some you lose some, that's in the game
 It's in the game
 You win some you lose some, it's in the game
 It's in the game, it's in the game, it's in the game, it's in the game)

[Intro: Raekwon]
Yo man get ya ass in here man
You know the fuckin' Police lookin' for you man
Come on man, them niggaz just left here man
Come on man you know we got mad fuckin' blow
Up in the Motherfuckin' lab son
This nigga's off the hook man
Yo Chef talk to these niggaz man

[Raekwon]
We baggin' ounces in the back of the Maz'
Ostrich on, Wollriches, three Quarter-ness
A.D.I.D.A.S. wit Stan Smith's
The grant's on the Stove
And Aunt Lo about to come to the Lab-o
She givin' me some credit for clothes
That's the slang work for bricks, dicks
Analyze you neva know who lookin'
It's deranged world - wit snitches is Enterprisin'
Black Man hold on, like Magnums in the Wind
Cuz when it get cold, parole give a homey like ten
What's the prognosis: drugs, guns, and ounces of Gold fish
Fly reefer out-town, bitches is stone six
And birds back in 18 and played C.R.E.A.M
Gray beam, it's lean new A.D.I.D.A.S
jackets, flippin' up small dean
Visualizin' portraits, fresh cuts
Brand new Porsche’s
Going wit hand-to-hand, servin' the Source
Yo, runnin' from the Police
This day-to-day lifestyle where niggaz get arraigned
And get chain, it's like Psycal (??Psycho??)--blao!!

[Hook: Pete Rock]
Drug Dealers, Star and Celebrities (Ghetto Celebs)
Even dudes wit a few felonies (A few felonies)
In 'The PJ's' this what they tellin' me (Tellin' who?)
Sniffin' real hard but you not smellin' me (Smell me)
The crowd yellin' for 'Chef' 'Killa' and 'Pete Rock' (Pete Rock)
Got 'em movin' like the Millennium beat box (Beat Box)
Shit is all hood 'til they hear the heat cock (Whooo!)
Fall back and let the beat rock

[Masta Killa]
Degrees of experience qualifies me to speak in certain areas
Where many can't reach, so I prepared a speech for ya'll
To then listen while I spit the hot venomous shit
My whole Clique sick, infested wit the itchy tigger finger mob related
Noodle-leanie universal flag Beanie
Son you wouldn't want to see me black down, Masta .4 pound
Clip full of hallow tip round
Turn the fuckin' sound up
My cup runneth over Hennessey, the Bill Bixby
Ninja Scroll, niggaz that roll
My son did four in the hole
Tenant population, neva told, facin' Parole
Sipped the old gold style, beat it in trial
My mild-mannered .9 Bandit, flow drunk
Look at Skunk weed stickin'
Razor sharp rip 'em, bites lift 'em
We at the Jam direct
The Ghetto Gospel, collaboration
One word could change the nation
No doubt!

[Hook: Pete Rock]

[Raekwon]
Tuna Salad and Puma rackin' (??)
pushin' through the projects, captain
Get your money, yo show me no slackin'
We drive the meanest Joints
shoot through Medina wit a Evisu Jeans and Nina's
Stop by Juniors we hittin' cheeba
Briefly, crackers observe
You got the undercovers
Niggaz just love us, we know they suckers
You know what? - What? Mosey don't be nosey yo!
Watch these fake niggaz wit these Thank You cards
Them shits is bogey
Snitches in the hood up to no good
We would kill alot of Motherfuckers but the timin' ain't good
So while my bankroll climbin'
I be out on consignment, breezin'
Ki's wit 29 letter melted cheeses
All of my papers now in real estate
White folks been doin' this since '69
It's billions and killer weight
So prosperous moves wit the jewels, wit Wu Nikes on
It's cool don't eva act like niggaz ain't who (??)
One!

[Hook: Pete Rock]

[Outro: Raekwon]
Yea! we just sit back - in the Luxury Toasters
Slidin' through the Motherfuckin' projects
Stand away from you fake ass Motherfuckers
Layin' out in the BarberShop, gettin' fucked up cuts
We don't respect ya'll (Don't respect ya'll)

[Hook - 50 Cent]
Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck!
Boom boom chuck, Yeah, that's what's up!
Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck!
Boom boom chuck, b-boom, Shady!

[Verse 1 - Eminem]
There's never been this, much of a menace in this game as this
And it's the, most sinister duo in the business
Once again its the, illest and realest killas
The most villainous Dre protege, Shady apprentice
Drop them zeros and get with these heroes
Do you want losers or winners, This music is in us, and it's
Not over 'till we say it's finished and G-Unit spinners
Will keep spinnin', this is Hip Hop when it's in it's
Truest form, the greatest, Hate us or love us
Make voodoo dolls of us and keep stickin' those pins in us
Thick as his skin is or as short as his wick is
The trick is to be able to walk big as his dick is
And as sick as his music is, or was, still is
Whatever, forever, he will be the illest
To ever sh-shock the world, what to do next
He's already reconciled with his ex [reversed], a chainsaw and an axe
Jump a bitch's desk, strangle her neck
While we have sex while Bill Clinton plays the sax
I sprays the vex, yeah bring Shady on back
The maniac of rap, devil baby on crack
Resurrect, I never left, baby I'm bad
I've gone mad, my comrade Dre-zy automatically
He says I'm too broke to fix, way beyond that
I may be off drugs, but it's made me off track
In fact, this right here very well could be the last rap
I ever do spit, I'll never do shit, that's that
Fuck it I quit, suck on a dick, jackass
I'm done with this wack ass rap, kiss my black ass!
(50 Cent!)

[Verse 2 - 50 Cent]
Nah, Em, tell 'em to kiss my black ass, the clean parts, the shitty parts
My bullet wounds, my beauty marks, the Fif'll tell you're ass apart!
A came in this game, crush a motherfuckers from tha start
Shady paid me, Shady crazy, Fifty crazy rich, bitch
Different day, nothing change, it's the same shit, trick
Teflon wrapped on, case I get clapped on
D's searching the whip, glad I left the mac home
Still grindin', still shinin', nigga lord knows
You're rockin with the kid that spit sicka sick flows
I carried Game's style for nine months and gave birth to it
Now I'm feeling like a proud father watching him do it
E'eryday Dre day, front and cause a maylay
Turn the town upside down wit a frown upside down
I smile through sumthin' fowl, and watch my money pile
I'm fuckin' with strict stacks, I'm kickin' you stripped fats
I hit you with it, bag it, pump it, bring me mines right back!

[Hook - 50 Cent] (Eminem)
Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck!
Boom boom chuck, Go 'head, funky funk up!
Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck!
Boom boom chuck, Yeah, that's what's up!
Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck!
Boom boom chuck, I hit yo' ass up!
Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck!
Boom boom chuck, Yeah, that's what's up! (Yeah!)

[Bad Boy]
(Verse 1)
I'm uncommonly
The bass hits kind of wobbly
The scene hit like a robbery
The air pace like a muh'fucker
I bounced out
The only thing underground now's my mom's house (Ha ha)
The first heard
Last
I took niggas in class
Then pull a pistol on your ass
You know
I shouldn't have to say it
I don't need to
Eses way deep, shake two in the neck
Question, question, lowrider
Loco, that's owned by us
Walkin' in my own white chucks
And you can have all nine bucks
Back, if you stock my stuff
I'm too nice
I don't shine, but I'm too bright
I don't rest, but I do ride (Eastside)
I'll refrain, scrapin', hoppin' Daytons
My nigga head straight for the stations and tell 'em

Repeat Chorus Twice

(Verse 2)
Now listen, man, this Bad Boy gon' get it
With no rest, my flow's exhibit/Xzibit
You got it?
I got some jewels in my pocket
I got CDs in the market
I'm like some mix
When you drop it
I'm like some coke when you rock it
I'm like a gun when you cock it
I wanna roam where 2Pac did
All the way to where Big Pop' live
Then do it like the homie Frost did
I'm unstoppable
I'm as serious as hospitals
Cause I don't speak unless it's logical
And they said it was impossible (Bitch)
Now they callin' me the Rock Gamble (Gamble...)
So what's next?
I wanna write lots of checks (That's right)
I wanna have lots of sex
I'm on a straight rock my Lex
Cause my time is like a box of threats
So go ahead and call me, Mex-ican

Repeat Chorus Twice

(Verse 3)
It's on now
Have you checked the skills
I came to prove a point, I ain't expectin' deals
So put your hands up, nigga, I'm a grab my handcuffs
And tie you up to your man, brah
Ya ain't leavin'
This polo goin' cholo theivin'
So follow cause it's low-low season
I wanna have a low-low meetin'
And show 'em what the cholos bringin'
I wanna have the whole world singin' (Come on)

Repeat Chorus Twice

Ahh this is Precious

	Here comes the bride
	Dr. Funken, with the bride

If you're married and you know what it's all about
Let's turn it out, scream it out and shout, sing

	Here comes the bride
	Don't you know that, it's

Hit me
The Lady Precious Funk is here
The bride of the funk so have no fear
Commiting myself to the funk for life
That's why they call me your funk Precious wife
The captain and the crew gave me away
They told me that the funk would never stray
I gotta keep the funk movin on and on
I'm Precious Funk, on your microphone!

	Here comes the bride
	Dr. Funken, with the bride

I'm married to the funk without a doubt
Everybody in the place say turn it out!
(Turn it out!)
	Here comes the bride
	Don't you know that, it's

To all you mothers standin out there
You got to give up the funk, get up out your chair
Because I am the bridge and that's a fact
I'm on a groove so smooth and so laid back
I'm gonna take the time, to talk to you
About somethin old, but oh so new
You see marriage to me is like thick and thin
A promise forever, that could never end
Ain't nothin in the world like a menu sale
to what we call lovin not nothin else
They've been doin this ever since Adam and Eve
They've been doin this, for centuries!

	Here comes the bride
	Dr. Funken, with the bride
		Here comes the bride
		Dr. Funken, with the bride
	Here comes the bride
	Don't you know that, it's

Get myself somethin
to hold onto
Call it funk music
and here's a little funk, just for you

Ah if a man wants me to be his wife
He better think about it first cause I'm talkin bout life
You see I'm talkin bout the good things with the bad
You see I'm talkin bout happiness with the sad
You see I'm talkin bout a thing called tender lovin care
A man not a mouse who will always be there
Someone that I can be all my life around
To keep me up, and never let me down

	The Doctor and Precious Funk got married
Y'all know what I'm talkin about?
	A microphone and bass for life they carry
	The Doctor and Precious stay together
	Love livin and makin funk for-ever
	The Doctor and Precious Funk got married
	A microphone and bass for life they carry
	The Doctor and Precious stay together
	Love livin and makin funk for-ever

Get myself somethin

(repeat 2X)

	Here comes the bride
	Dr. Funken, with the bride
		Here comes the bride
		Dr. Funken, with the bridge
	Here comes the bride
	Don't you know that, it's

I'm Blondie, world's precious ride
Don't take no stuff I got my pride
A man marry me he got to be nice
A girl like me don't come by twice
Dr. Funk, say you want me
Too hot to trot, I'm Blondie
Just sittin on the funk and ridin on the groove
Dr. Funk, you're so damn cool

I married the funk, so I could never be alone
The music, the voices, and the microphone
The stagelights, and the fancy cars
is a matrimony for superstars
The Doctor asked me to be his girl
so he could groove provides, and rock my world
Don't give me up, and don't turn me loose
Cause I'm Angie B I got all the juice

Got myself somethin
to hold onto
Call it funk music
And here's a little funk, just for you

	Here comes the bride
	Dr. Funken, with the bride

	Here comes the bride
	Don't you know that, it's

	A microphone and bass for life they carry
	The Doctor and Precious stay together
	Love livin and makin funk forever

Song:   The Chosen Are Few
Typed by: graumit@hotmail.com

[Thrust]
Have you ever took the time to write a rhyme on the train
Looking inspiration sparked from the brain
Erased the pain, doors are closing seems you're not going to make it
Your life is yours if you want to take
Now fake it, shake it bake it
You seen some of us, yo we couldn't make it
Suffering like spotting me at Dufferin
A true head looking for Bufferin
Ain't that something
Ain't about as close as who brings in the most
Energy redirected by those in my commitee
I'm rough rugged, witty
Miss Biggie, but far from jiggy jiggy jiggy *echoed*

CHORUS [Kardinal Offishall] {Thrust}
Yo, the chosen are few {I'm here to let you know}
Yo, if the shit is wack {just where your shit can go}
And if you don't know {I came to rule the show}
I was chosen to do this {you know}

[Thrust]
People always asking me what I'm doing next
Trying to have fun and enjoy this flex
My rap career reflect comic book like Gladys
Swingin on the ep, yo he's on the apparatus
Doing it after dark, while watching South Park
At the same time, my rhymes are murderous crime
Do y'all know the doubter, or what's it's all abouter
I miss the news, scream and shouter
No other way to tell you without being rude
That sign on the door do not intrude
Outlined in chalk stiff, body frozen
Only a few will be chosen

CHORUS *reverse lines* X2

[Thrust]
My creative juices and abundant wealth
That resides in a place where thoughts prevail
That fact got you gell, you fell under my spell
Batting average coming up low
A future prospect, and never played with the pros
And you got the nerve to be appearing at my shows
Two thousand niggas be thinking so slow
I pause the frame, erase you form the picture
Bring this mixture, of vex to the pitcher
Step to me don't bring weak thought
Now I jack my thing from this green stalk
Mind when you walk, I plant land mines in history
Evolution of time, remains a mystery
Mr. Kardinal and big Thrust is making history
That's why the crowd is steady steady steady dissing we
Ha ha ha

CHORUS X2
CHORUS [Both]
Yo, the chosen are few, and I'm here to let you know
Yo, if the shit is wack, just where your shit can go
And if you don't know, I came to rule the show
I was chosen to do this, in stere-ereo

[Intro: Bobby Creekwater]
Yesssss, ladies and gentlemen (yeah man)
Bobby Creekwater, today's host
Today's narrator, yeah
(We do this shit every year around this time)
Today's what-the-fuck-ever you wanna call it
But I need y'all to sit back, and listen
Listen man (fuck what you write man, just go get 'em)

[Verse One]
An executive mindframe, fuck tryin to rap
Niggaz represent a corner, I refined the map
Artesian water, this is flow untapped
And rep for 'em like Mike on playoff night; that's if the payoff right
The dream team, Bobby Creek, Em, 50 and them
We +Run the City+ like Diddy and them
The opposition we just pityin them, it's no chance
Put you niggaz in the special olympics is no dance
I'm nice like a meal twice, nigga no grams
Get them bitches out they pants, I did it with no hands!
See, one thing's for sure I'm pure uncut
Baby you can either stay down or get gunned up
Mr. Night Life, I can give you niggaz sun up
I just get an order, let my niggaz pick the gun up
That's one up on ya, nigga wake yo' punk ass up
This is ammonia, fuck your face up
Bitches won't even telephone ya
I can space age pimpin, a pocket full of stone ya
Ya dig?  Take the world over that's the gig
Sell enough units have Paul and Jimmy dancin the jig
Roll the Maserati through the city, me and Riggs
Bumpin Obie Trice, shoot a bird at the pigs
Ever since a nigga got rich
Life is still a bitch but she a high class bitch
I just wanna fuck with me a high class bitch
Nigga pitch that on some eyeglass shit
See I classic, enough to get the mics back right
And I'm a fan of record sales, I don't like that hype
I'm here to end it

[Chorus]
Oh Lord that nigga mean, ain't he?
Yea, goddamn that nigga clean, ain't he?
Yea, see he a greedy baby
But some people tend to call him the return of Shady
There he is - goddamn that nigga clean, ain't he?
Yea, oh Lord that nigga mean, ain't he?
Yea, see he a greedy baby
But some people tend to call him the return of Shady
Bobby Creek, Bobby Creek...

[Verse Two]
Yea, yeah
Nice like Mike right, you niggaz soft as night lights
Diamond's a tall order I'm just tryin to get the hype right
I'm throwed off, so hard, so soft, sold out
Bought the Coupe a color of nice weather and rolled out
I can't hold out, hot like a fish fried
Who the fuck is this guy? The ruler on the disc I
Hit you in your suit coolers, I'm in the Coupe cooler
than pigskin men base runners and hoop shooters
A loose screw ban money like the legendary Roots crew
This is just the shit that I am used to
Oh nah, I don't bust a chopper but I used to
Now I put the word out - I'm sure you niggaz heard 'bout
Young boss sold money, old school new paint
Ball knowin you can't, give a fuck what you think
Member of the mighty Shady Records, nigga you ain't
Think you fuckin with me then double whatever you drink
You can't fathom what the bitch throwin at him
Couple niggaz hatin on him but the fans waitin on him
like a, PlayStation 3, money for your advance
My vacation fee, ain't no use in hatin me nigga
And don't shit-talk pimp, I'd rather flush
anyone with big enough nuts to come and fuck with us
I bust but keep in mind, pressure bust pipes
And you niggaz wouldn't bust a grape in a fruit fight
What the fuck? (yeah)

[Intro: Hell Razah]
1-2, 1-2, yo, you could hear me?
1-2 turn me up

[Hell Razah]
I've been a threat since Benetton Gazelles in Valleys
The Icon in graffiti in the Brooklyn Alley
Touch hearts of the Pharaohs in the Egypt Valley
My Engineer can't see me cuz the Booth is cloudy
Still rowdy even though we in BM's and Audis
Lookin like black Saudis in black Denalis
I'ma terrorist attack when I get on the track
If I'm ridin' Shotgun I need one in my lap
I adapt in any Habitat, a BK Desert rat
It's war, then we sendin' back bodies and gats
Flip the white flag homey and it get worst than Iraq
We know the CIA game was to frame us wit crack
So each bar's more dope, heroin in my pen
Got a ??Marvin?? back robbin', head 'noddin again
Who you shit on to get on top could make it pop in the end
Who's the flop and what's hot got you locked in the Gym
Tell Jacob I spit Jewels I could drop 'em a Gem
And if he's lookin' for a Diamond I could hook 'em wit Tim

[Hook: Timbo King] & {Hell Razah}
I'm hip-hop before Sugarhill signed a deal
Before Studio 54 poppin pills
It was real when Kool Herc worked the wheels of steel
Now we bring the game back into a New York field

5% Nation of Godbodies greetin' wit peace
I'm Raw like Kane, my lyrics are formed in solid rock
Spit it hotter than '86 on drug infested blocks
Last photo of 'Pac before his Beamer got shot
I'm the Queens, one man Supreme Team
Triple Beam Dream, Microphone Cream Fiend

2-5 Costra Nostra, heart of this culture
The game ain't over
I'm the truce troop war reporter, legal life stick you
Against All Odds, not the ordinary shit you use to
I'm C-Murder before the life sentence
Predicate felons, homicide chasin' niggaz, hopin' over benches

All I need is a beat-box
And I'mma run through niggaz like Sheep rock
We flop? we gon' have to run up in weed spots
These glocks could send fake niggaz to meet 'Pac
We got - the pick that could open your key lock
If Hip-Hop is dead, then in this House of Madness
I'mma raise the dead out of that Mental Casket
No, niggaz 16 that'll sell you Ratchets
That drew when they see any jewelry flashin'
I still be at Bk Kool G Rappin'
You come through the wrong dude will sell you Aspirin
We still got luv for Ole Dirty Bastard
We judged by 12, six carry the casket
My gat spit, that's it, niggaz do backflips
My Black whips pull up to the Clubs and bag Chicks (Get in, get in)
This rap shit got niggaz thinkin' they that sick (Look at 'em)
'Til Sixth Grade I stayed on some read and math shit
I'm hood but Intelligent, ????????
When Hoes buyin' clothes off the poles of Saks Fifth
And I don't eat pork, Enzymes and cat-fish
And what you gonna do when the streets is cash-less
Take 2 pulls of my weed and pass it (Gimme my shit!)
Wit these beats I'mma toe tag it and body bag it
I don't want a deal if I gotta be a faggot (Naw I'm good)
These homos and 'E' addicts, go'head and have it
Cuz I don't need no money that bad to toss salad
From Brooklyn to Paris stay blowin' that Cactus
That match wit my Army Jacket, Green Cabbage
My bars be 24 Karats for the Average

Verse 1:
California critical shit 12" inch 
One strip so they eat up your whole compact disc 
Los Angeles
Take they terrorists
Blond wave black fist incredible lyricist
In a never endin' quest to get rich
I hold a grip with time to breathe
More tricks up my sleeve than about forty thieves
With forty ____ in a weed spot runnin' they tree
All money to me the 360 degree
Now we max and relax like cool breeze
But they all fucked up in the street 
Avoidin' front page fame so I'm holdin' my heat 
So low key that none of you niggas is knowin' me
In '98 I only see weed
Only we hopin' Allah see me 
And only be left bless my family tree
Until 2000 but fuck school like '83
Off Hennessy for all enemy
Lovin' dollars like all you gangstas love Impalas
Never put a bitch before your momma
Stay tuned 
For the love hella right to 12 jewels
Nigga you know the rules

Typed by: kirenamloh@msn.com

[Intro/Hook 2X]
Thiiiiiiiiiings... - Things ain't what they used to be

[Verse One]
Emergency, ambulance patrollin my storm
The ground's bloddy, bodies blasted, bastards {?} fall
Lost and found...confusion...
A murder mystery fusion; for me to R&B/behave that's an illusion
I need not no white man's hand
to give 'em the five on the black hand's side
'Cause that's that bull jive, I've thrive to survive
since nine-seven-seventy-five
My date of birth when my Timbs first touched the EARTH...
Now there's a hood headed for riches
Later for these blind swine witches
Cornball cops is throwin curves all pitches
Man hunt, for big mouth snitch
Who sold out for three crack rock, teeth start to twitch
as he points the finger for 5-0 and thens ta pull the trigger QUICKA...(quicka...)
..Please! Things ain't what they used to be!

[Chorus: Justine Simmons]
Mercy, mercy meeeee-heeeeeeee...
I said things ain't what they used to be, no..no-oh....

[Hook 4X]

[Verse Two]
What's resurrected with the old school ways?
They got the microphone grip in times to save todays
Bullets through bodies while it sees it seems
around the block the fiends be catchin wreck for greens
Daily battles on the hot playgrounds
and hear the sound, "buck BUCK" and then the rain comes down
True blues on my tube, I'm lookin and my hip-hop's dead
'cause all these wannabes a bred
Whatever happened to the real "Summer Madness?"
Run-D.M.C., wit "My Adidas" was the baddest!
The bomb step, with the Kangol hats
Gold chains around the necks of crew who made the name
Funny, that people crave for the rug {?}
Jump around BUCKTOWN, there the {?} it's at
I know the world's +Doggy Dogg+, but stop +Snoopin'+, G
..cause things ain't what they used to be

[Chorus and hook]

[Justine Simmons]
I can't take the memories, of once upon a time
It only gets the best of me, and it's always on my mind
Just show them how to love and/or teach 'em to be kind
The children are our future, they always on my miiiiiiiiiiind-dah!

I said mercy, mercy meeeee-heeeeeeee...
I said things ain't what they used to be, no..no-oh....
Mercy, mercy meeeee-heeeeeeee...
I said things ain't what they used to be, no..no-oh....

Song:   I've Been Thinking

Intro: Common

Yeah, one two, bless
Yeah yeah, check it
I got my mellow Sean Lett
He gonna get down for y'all Chicago style
Eighty-seven, you know the bidness, check it

Chorus: Common, Sean Lett

After eight years of my life, of smoking and drinking
The world keeps spinning, so lately I've been thinking

After eight years of my life, of smoking and drinking
The world keeps spinning, so lately I've been thinking

Verse One: Common

Nearest to the go gothic, a cash flow prophet
Methods of gettin scratch and talkin slick I've adopted
Palms in the lock with stunts whose hearts be game
Hoes in the stable, none do I claim
Niggaz with nothin to shoot for, at they only aim
Gramps in the choir singin it's gonna rain
in the midst of precipitation, I make the power
manipulations, so my offspring'll be straight for generations
Got connections in the nation
To incarceration, to general population
More lyrics than Jason, look me in the face when you speak to me
You got a tattoo?  Bitch youse a freak to me
Seeking the, good sess material
Asking when's my next video
Bitch get a job and get your ass in somebody's university
Enroll your youngun in a nursery
And cleam him up, comb his hair, cover yourself
You want a man to love you you ain't loving yourself
I'm discovering wealth watches wisdom in ways
To make it in the last days, now bring it on

Chorus

Verse Two: Sean Lett

I feel blessed I survived two decades in this world
Then Ninety slid in naked now I got a baby girl
Ain't this a bitch, myself still a child
I want to hang on eighty-seven corners act wild on Stoney Isle
Better school her, so presence is your seed in society
Parks of envy jealous niggaz crack fiends yes indeed
I won't misleed and you can best believe
I'm just a blink away shorty anytime that you need
See I know right now, you're just too young to understand
Asking questions, why pops and moms don't be holding hands
Don't you worry about it yet, in due time we'll explain
Why having you, created just an everlasting shame
Bringing joy witcha smiles, tripping when you first walked
Knowing somebody's child is gettin outlined in chalk
Just relieved it ain't you, I got much love for you boo
Cause it ain't nuthin that these skanless niggaz in these streets won't do
Stop me if I'm lying, see my race is steady dying
Short methods to making cream, bullets sprays and shatters dreams
See basically, Chi-town's game-related and designed
Niggaz store up theirs and down opposite signs

Chorus

Outro: Sean Lett, Common

It's like that y'all (yeah yeah)
Common Sense and dirty mizer on the set y'all
Sean Lett

We gonna get down like that
My man Eddie C on the board
We coming through y'all for eighty-seventh street
Seventy-first and everybody in South show
We coming through for niggaz on the West side
Down in the ickies, all up and down state
We gonna keep it straight like that
We straight out for gold
You call it Chi-town it's still our town
Holding it down like this with that eighty-seven sound

We talking about rocking niggaz state to state nationwide
On the real it's like that
Straight up South side is where we loaf
Shit be real around these parts, I'm serious
YouknowhatI'msayin?  Hear me
You know what?  We out though

I'm about to open up this mic and fix it
Simplistic
Linguistic
Technician
Fusion
With fision in a vision
Like I'm in a television
Via satellite
You wanna battle, right?
Yeah, press the channel
Refer to your manual
You rhyme semi-annual
I make fresh rhymes... daily
Never did my school work
So they tried to fail me
Never told me nothing about Hailey
Selassie
Call me Special Ed
'Cause they don't see what I see
Ultra-
Violet
Flight pilot
Keep your wallet
Give me your dedication
Druggy with your medication
Have ya waitin'
Out in the rain
For a train and a bus
I was made from dust
Lazarus
Style: hazardous
Church Ave., straight from Erasmus
 
I'm deep like the sea floor
I'll make you see four
When there's one
You be stunned
Didn't see me come, but yeah, I'm right here
Up in your ear like q-tips or wax
Either which one, relax
And keep still
Peep skill
As I get deep like a drill
In a molar
I roll like a stroller
Sold a
Whole lotta records in my life
I hop flights to rock mics
While you frontin' for the cars
Or maybe for the chicks
I walk right through
And I'm steppin' on ya kicks
Right to the mic
Front and center
Don't nothin' enter
This area is restricted
Too much heat, you need liquid
Caution:
It's scorchin'
You don't wanna go there
I got it locked down... I did a show there
 
You don't wanna get me mad
I'll put you in a bag
And tie it
Like Wyatt
Earp
You'll get hurt
I'm much worse
I touch first
I don't scream and curse
I just breath deep
And I put you to sleep
Like hypnosis
Givin' you fatal doses
Rap ulcers
I rhyme aggressive
Get the message?
I bring forces
You can't stop
Like a pack of wild horses
Comin' back
To they extensions
I'm the kid everybody mentions
When you say: classic
When you say: lyric
Originality, performance and spirit
I don't wanna hear it
Bring it and I'll put it on you
And make you wear it
Where the stage?
Clear it
Anybody come near it
Let 'em come
And leave you shinin'
Red rum
And then some

{M-M-M-M-M-M-Maybach Music}
Ugh, ugh, ugh

[Rick Ross]
Sometimes I get so fuckin paranoid
Reminiscin on how them bricks keep goin back and forth
I ask the lord for everything I lack and more
Last thing on my mind was slammin Caddy doors
I just made up my mind, I'm grindin like a boss
Dedicated our lives, sacrifices we lost
Fatal mistakes, talkin laws of attraction
The paper I'm makin, I upgraded my fashion
Everything tailor made, floss is my passion
Loyalty came first, number one rule in the faction
Follow my actions, came in at oh-six
Planted my flag bitch I'm takin no shit
I toted them toolies, I bullied the bullies
I made a few hits, my bank account Jewish
You niggaz is minor, the money manure
I'm thinking like Heinman, Godfather the 4th
It was never filmed, therefore never seen
It was never him, that's what these haters scream
I wrote the script, I was sippin lean
Now meet the myth, I brought along my triple beam

[Chorus: Omarion]
This thing of ours
It's a mafioso
You ain't never know though
Never gon' know so
No never, no never, no never
No, no, no, no

[Wale]
This reefer the sweetest, got me thinkin much deeper
They don't rap for a reason, this is rather convenient
Spend money with my team, made my money from hustle
Women love you for free, niggaz hate you for nothin
Never hate you in public, but they let they eyes tell it
Ain't even 5'11", what the fuck you got scared of?
I'm a loose cannon, screws damaged
And I do think hip-hop music needs some newer standards
Hardest working conglomerate, and that's word to my momma
Getting up in they mental, get 'em outta they garments
Adamantly comin at whoever call up for drama
Just know that D.C., Philly, Ohio, Miami got us
Private jet over water, now Dietrich got no barber
I see feds, I go that way~! That DMV shit saw us
When you young and you black, they see you as a target
So before them foamposites get your lawyers in order

[Chorus]

[Nas]
The Don of all Dons, since you wanna call me somethin
All of a sudden, niggaz ball and stuntin, y'all just started pullin on
How riders pull your car, ya spineless
Where your heart? I know where mine is
A don is one who accept things he cannot change
Only thing I accept I cannot change is gettin old and dyin
Gold medallion, over my son chest
He'll hold it down when I sunset
What does death mean to me? I never owned the concept
I was here - I'm just a spirit, let's get one thing clear
Everything segues into each other
One thing is just an extension of the other
My kid to me, I am my children through history
Of stand up men and stand up women
I am existin I was conceived to break bread with kings, and make connections
We haven't met yet? My reputation you've stuck with
Until we have our formal introduction that's enough
But every male is not a man
So some of those that will hold out they hand won't understand, this thing of ours

(Don't wanna be stumblin baby)

Intro/Chorus:

This is for them hustlers scufflin for them ends
tryin ta get a mill, (fancy cars) and a house on the hill
*repeat*

Verse 1:

I dwells in the city, a bank is where ya bound to suffer
Lifestyle filled with hoodsters, players and hustlers
Busters wanna shut me down, I suppose
cos I'm makin cash flow as my ghetto life dispose
I gets my hustle on from dust to dawn, Perignon
(Damn, how my life transformed like Voltron!)
Chargin like Natron by any means
These collard greens is goin quicker than the forests are evergreen
Now one-time tryin ta shut me down cos I'm on a 
mission makin ends in my Benz bendin corners

Fools be Coupe deVille yet still I stay real wit mine
If the 10 reaches dome, so long! So catch me next time
So, wordly rhymes they been kind to me
Hoes lie to me, make me try to be what they not, see
I'm gonna call you Wimpy (Can I please bawl, word?)
A dollar a day and ya gladly pay me back tomorrow
Hell no! I feel no sorrow, I scuffle to get this mill
I've excelled, grab a grip, need no chip for this packed 10

Chorus

Verse 2:

Triple beam, 30 schemes and crack fiends
got me to the point where I can make my 6-4 lean
Hard times got me bussin cheques that ain't mine
I got good credit but like I said it ain't mine
I'm stressed out and I need paper therapy
I'm sick and tired of family and friends takin care of me
I'm on a one-way ticket to lavish homes and cars
Do anything to make a mill and be a ghetto star

Well what'd make you laugh or make you cry?
Where things that come faster
live it last and the weak'll surely die
Multiply life times death, what's left?
A big house on the hill and I can feel this best quest
As Uncle Sam ain't the man he supposed to be
we out here gettin lynched while most niggas baggin groceries
Most of these wannabe's get they meal ticket
Claimin they from hoods
it's still too good but they don't still kick it

Chorus

Verse 3:

Livin the lifestyles of the po' and lonely
only takes my mind to mould to make a grip of money
Funny how time flies when you ain't broke
Gotta gets me a mill cos I feel I can't cope, though
I'm down and out in the S-C, less C
Gimme a biz and then get rid of Betsy
I know the whole world on first name basis
But still I get ignored by friends in high places
The chase is on, I gots ta get paid
I'm special like ed. so you can say I got it made

My flows got it buggin, don't mess with my Clicc man
Snap lyrics like a picture, make em say Dougie's a sick man
Hustle every day that's the way that I was brought up
Gotta make more chips than Ruffles, scuffle, sneaky plan thought up
Caught up wit Tone Def, not Fargo, or will I wells
Landcruiser, swimmin pools and watchin my pockets swell
Dosha all the time, all about that money money moneyyyyyy!!!
Wit a top-notch crew now all my jokes is funny

[Intro: Pusha T]
King Push, RZA, razor, execution

[Pusha T]
The devil is a liar, you ain't broke bread, til you taste the devil's pie
They say his laugh sounds like an angel when he cries
What better camouflage when the halo's your disguise, them wings don't fly
Your traitor is your neighbor, at your front porch
And he's handing you your paper, bathrobe on
But the swords underneath, and they wanna see your blood
As it pours in the street, it's the mark of the beast
The meek shall inherit the earth, the weak shall inherit the dirt
You each should of perished at birth, still born or aborted
Every street tax gotta come with an audit
Either your life or your loved ones, straight razor or a snub gun
From the village where the thugs from
Same corner that you copping all your drugs from
He a hero but he unsung, I'm the one

[Raekwon]
The Chambers is 36, the new and improved
Now make a move, these guns whistle, sizzle up dudes
Who got big mouths, no power, run to the bank
With no dollars, got the nerve to switch crews
We better then the rest of them, my guess is the estrogen
And all the money we got, will move like the Mexicans
And cartel, compound, and Carvel, the large scale
It's Scarsdale, I fuck with golf, now, Shallah's ill
Yeah, the coke is fresh, straight out of Bermuda, yo
I'm chilling on the beach in Boca, chica with tuna
Salads and palaces, yo, we smoke out them chalices
Passing off balances, and bread til the Island, since
Ninety eighty four, the blow is just more
Then we would come through with rifles, rocking night boots in war
A real niggas invention that came from a henchman
Who blew up, now through the Wu up, that's my redemption

[Chorus: Pusha T sample]
"Drug dealer, been that nigga half my life
Drug, drug dealer, been that nigga half my life
You niggas talking, but you ain't never them
Imagine been first name basis with the kingpin"

[Joell Ortiz]
God I was Lucifer's neighbor
You wouldn't believe some of the things these people do for this paper
Moving with lasers and the rugers, make a move, you make the papers
Lose-lose situation, sweat up blood, you get to choose what you bath in
A chemist cook work, the runner's foot work
The customs took work, the soldiers put work in
On any one of them muthafuckas who fuck up good work
Bosses tell 'em good work, that just how the hood work
Northface bubble with eight bundles under it
Gold front upper lip smile while I was hugging it
I lied, I wasn't Lucifer's neighbor, he who I'm fucking with
My mom blew that snow in her nose, but I would hustle it
Champ hoodie, mongoose with the pads
Clap your stoup up, hit mom dukes in the legs
That's beef, nigga, ya'll aint street niggas
Ya'll peep niggas, write it down and try to be niggas
Fucking everything, neck heavy swing
Second hand swept across that pretty break leg
In that Nissan Honda Chevy thing, peddling
Whatever bring, fetti' in, steadily I fed my whole time

[Chorus]

[Pusha T]
In this art of war, my pen stroke is Picasso
Niggas get the picture, I ain't gotta paint the nostrils
You know my origin is over, when
Fat black bitches singing over organs
Die for a dollar, pride you don't swallow
You save that for the one you buying red bottoms
Yuck, that's the price you gotta pay for it
Alls fair love and war, she masquerade for it
Woo, Jack-O-Lantern Push
Trick or treat, fucking shit, I earned it off the books
Now listen to me vent, when you sit and watch
It's like tires being spinned, shots from everywhere
But they never make a dent, knight in shining armor
Mistake me for the villain, cuz my vengeance is your karma
Yeah, fear is knowing your a goner
It's music to my soul cuz it's death before dishonor, gone

[Danny Brown]
Got the tongue of a pimp, raised by a dirty preacher
That used the church money, to cop a new beemer
Got the heart of a child, raised by a prostitute
That bought his mama the rubbers when the john came through
It's the microphone methadone, bringers of that extra stone
You ain't getting pussy like your prom date had a chaperon
Popping pills, got a nigga brain like a labyrinth
Called the ho on purpose but I got the brain on accident
Niggas, I'm your majesty, show up with a bag of weed
Roll a blunt so perfect, thought it came up out a factory
My manuscript be the man with the boldest grapes
The insomniac with nightmares in sixteens
I'm a wet dream, dry sense of humor
Travel in class like a high school rumor
No one really cares if your embarrass us with style
Cuz when it comes to them raps, you been letting us down
So tell 'em why you mad, son, gotta get it off your chest
Let 'em know how you feel, son
Ya'll gotta say what you gotta say
It don't matter, they gon' say a nigga hating, anyway

Song:   Tight Situation
Typed by: davpaul@dove.net.au

Intro:

(Gettin closer to God......)
(Gettin closer to God......)
(Gettin closer to God in a tight situation now)

Now what do I do? I got nowhere to turn and run and hide
Often contemplate suicide
on my mind, but it keep me thinkin
Steady drinkin, the liquor, got my shit gettin thicker
And it seem my time on Earth is gettin short
Two puffs left on my last Newport
Lock the Glock and the 9, lock one in the chamber
Danger, danger, pull the purse off a stranger

While each step walks the fine line between pleasure and pain
It causes the brain to remain sane
>From questions learned from lessons daily
Evil tries to persuade me into contemplation if I'm crazy

Probably not, but who gives a damn if I shot
I can end this bullshit in just one clock

Hold the Glock, it's still ticks left on the clock
It ain't no crock, so I shop in a state of shock

Lookin for a J-O-B, but I can't see
how I'm to survive, on $4-25?
I's, don't know what to do
I keep paging ol' G-O-D, seems like I can't get thru

Walk the night streets with my piece as my peace
Shaky face make me rethink, all these thoughts bringin heat
to the dome, makin niggas well, really will prevail
Is it better in hell or psycho in a jail cell?
Well I can't tell, hearin noises, turn to voices
I'm seein choices, none of mine rejoice this
Another day in the life of a crook
As I graze in the pages of the Good Book

Break:

(Gettin closer to God.....) (x4)
(Gettin closer to God in a tight.....)
(Gettin closer to God in a tight situation)

It goes a BRRRREA, stick em, HOT HOT HOT, sick em
Put em up, I gots the 9 and a ski mask, that's how I dick em
Never lag, black denim pants sag
Ain't nothin personal so put the personals in the black bag
Lie down wit'cha hands behind ya back
Don't neighbour roll cos the party's in the act
Just in case you're wonderin who's the boss?
I'm well hung to keep the shit strung like some dental floss
Cos the streets ain't nothin but a (tight situation)
In a 24-hour occupation
Just last night, a brother tried to rob ya blind from behind
when I came up the stairs, I was stuffed waist-deep
He use ta wear black sweatshirt and black skullie
Now he's lyin face down in a pitch black gully
Shit's no joke, the streets is like pneumonia
You can't shake the feel when the steel runnin up on ya

Like u-hoo, Uncle Sam?
Where the hell's the mule and the forty acres of land
that you promised to my ancestors when we was emancipated
Claim to set us free but we was still segregated
Now all thru this nation, got these black folks dropped and shamed
They locked in chains but now you know it's on again
Cos we're comin at'cha just like markets
Everytime we spark this gun, don't wanna run up on ya
And grasp this noose around your neck
Then hang you from the tallest tree up in them projects
Got our women with no welfare cheques, powder milk and butter
While our friends be on the corner sellin shit, killin each other
Niggas on tough, none tough, holler if you hear me
Gotta million black folk ready to march down on D.C.

Interlude:

Y'all brothers better realise that in the '95, it's either homicide or
genocide
If y'all can't find nothin to live for, find somethin to die for, nigga
And that's on the real

Takin a walks thru the streets of my city, yo
The Buddha fillin my eyes, it ain't pretty though
Blushed nose mockin the spots on the concrete
It's residue from an earlier drug meet
Concrete jungle, that's what they call it
Well each day we're raged, a-palled
Cos what it is, is a concrete hell
Am I livin in a house or a goddamn jail cell?
Bars on my windows, bars on my doors
Shots ring out and I'm divin on the fuckin fllor
What in the hell kinda way is this to live, yo?
This can't go on, somthin's gotta give

You Spit that real shit you best stand by it
You fuck with Mista MC I'm Goin Start A Riot
Now you came up to my face so I had to rearranged it
You lost ya life now and you muthafuck'n can't change shit
You knew I was lethal and I'm deadly like a pill
But when you fuck with me it's like a bad drug deal
I'm all about slangin some records fuck narcoudics
Take ya familys bodys and tape'm up in some boxes
The Hood I Claim is the 619 till the day I die
In the hood you lost your life now it's time to say bye
Drive bys happen redeemly death is eternady
Talk'n shit so I burned your family in a inferno G
You can't deny it I met Nate D-O Double G
At the same time I'm ready to kill for my Scrille

We leap the fence and seek defense and then we blast
Like The Icons say we always getting fucked up
While I bust shots at your crew so they get bucked up

Your crew is getting shot up
Your hoe is getting dicked up

And you shut the fuck up

[Verse Two]
Death isn't a happy thing but it's gotta muthafuckin happen
Bitch ass muthafuck'n talk'n shit so they gettin slapped then
Talk'n shit well you should know it don't impress me
Drivin to fast to pull me over to harass and arrest me
They can't catch me cuz I'm reloading bullets freely
Dispersing slugs at pigs and poppin shit not meaningly
I don't give a fuck where they fly just make a pig die
Send that muthafuck'n from the earth to the blue sky
If he was on earth worshiped Jesus and got baptized
If he didn't he's goin have to goto hell and fuckin realized
No one lives a nice life with me by they fuckin side
Either way you goin die by a homicide or suicide
I'm ready to ride pistols collide and muthafuckas ready to die

Bullets dispers hollow tips bustin up some fuckin shirts
Leavin ya whole click punk bitch up in some dirt

[Chorus]

I'm ready to ride for my click as ya bitch sucks da dick
With whip cream on my shit and my dick on her click

"Greater than your Benz or your Lex" - De La Soul 'The Bizness'

[Verse One]
Deep in the depths of the mind
The pro is prime, trapped like a mime
In the same space and time, lifeless
Vocals excel when trifers
Centerfold of your ciphers
My aura shines divine, priceless
Much to complex to yap
Maybe perhaps when I think of rap
My thinkin' cap (what?)
Reveals the skills unlimited
Rappers be half as great
Mentally they can't elaborate
So they exaggerate and fabricate
My words collaborate, formulatin' a sentence
It's all ill when the blunted mind defense this
Intense mechanism 
Respect next to wisdom
Makes the god's mental
Inflammable grammable feel gentile
Reignin' dominate
We be the essential
I sense y'all don't know the art
Comprehensively, energy enters me when I depart
It's like sweet sorrow
Bottles I follow catch wreck
Engine's to my comprehension be just too complex
To get vex and just step
I'd rather snatch a rapper's rep
Ruin it to a degree
Breakin' them into debris
Vocally, y'all label me as the illest mic killa
Top biller
Still in the grind, the mind driller
Sublime thriller
Poetically is how I'm depicted
The rhythm's got me addicted so my ill skill inflicts it
On any device
Nice
Similar, the verbal Christ
Enormous, my performance equally will be precise
We puttin' rappers on ice
The ultimate heist
Most of 'em should have thought twice now they're payin' the price
I knock 'em out like Mic Tys when the tracks connect
The engine's to my comprehension is just too complex

[Scratch Chorus]
"Greater than your Benz or your Lex
The engine to my comprehension is just too complex" - De La Soul 'The Bizness'
Much too complex 
"Greater than your Benz or your Lex
The engine to my comprehension is just too complex"

[Verse Two]
To M.C. the art of rhymin' should be pure and natural
When I think of all these ill skills, international
You see my words in actual will attract the steel like a magnet
Niggas is stagnant and incomplete like the fragments
Actually, my words are a jagged edge, criminal
Borderline, subliminal
One of the earth's finest minerals
I'm past the pinnacle 
And still I hold my fort like a general
Intervals, all excerpt the maximum
Release the minimal energy
Cock me back 
Hennesy's sure to blur the memory
Remember me, that ill nigga?
I still trigger
Thoughts sporadic set to peel niggas
Standards
Mics are metaphors of what the man is, might merge
I recite slurs with the right words
What occurs when I conjure
Illest spirits from beyond ya
You was warned like Alaja
The drama ganja drains away 
Plain as day
When my mind's A.K. spray in the A.K.A.
Nine trey, double rays, bubble thin
Fry
Mass murderous
The illest niggas we devour from out the dark
So kill the talk
Either that or walk the walk
You claim you had your shit together now it's fallin' apart
Lyin' lion, no heart
Who woulda thought you'd be wack?
We gave you dap in the beginning now we takin' it back
I only boogie from a track when mad niggas react
We specify the artifacts and represent 'em on wax
It' complex 

[Scratch Chorus]
"Greater than your Benz or your Lex
The engine to my comprehension is just too complex" - De La Soul 'The Bizness'
Much too complex
"Greater than your Benz or your Lex
The engine to my comprehension is just too complex
Much too complex"

[Verse Three]
Let's take a deep breath and inhale and exhale
For those who prison in the minds and those that been bailed
Fuck the fan shit, it's about to hit the windmills
What I reveal, not omni still it's strictly been real
Y'all know the deal, skills
Steelos, alter egos
Poetry hits my peoples like food for thought
Vocals distort, shorts the sequels
Mics forever like the paradox of pure evil
The crowds will come
Like throwin' crumbs to the seagulls
Too predictable
Old folks pray in cathedrals
Tryin' to live that better life legal
Feeble, my mind remains haunted by mad things
I'm wanted
Plus everything is real when you're blunted
These days the trees blaze
F doin' the shade
We backspin 'em like the DJs
Playa be swaze
I'm the live one
Mic's like a knife
Cuttin' you down to size in 
The fantasy land you and your mans was devisin'
We wise men
Puzzle your thoughts
It ain't surprisin'
I set it off like horizons
No mistakes allowed
Strategically, it's like I'm movin' the crowd
I'm lickin' shots, bustin' up at the clouds
We be audacious, treadin' on glaciers
Slang got sprayed down in Tanqueray without the chasers
On the earth there ain't a place you can run to hide
When my sets collide with your planet
Rock bottom solid my frame be like granite
Very few can understand it
The dialect I wreck
Perfects my mic's sex when the thoughts connect
The engine to my comprehension is just too complex
The engine to my comprehension is just too [echo]

Song:   Too Much
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

You got beef, bring it with talk, ain't no need for violence
There's already too many men in the moment of silence
Too many with handkerchiefs, too many wreaths
because there's not enough indians and too many chiefs
Cause there's, too many tears, and too many sides
Too many "we gonna miss him"s, and too many goodbyes
Too many flowers for baskets, too many caskets
cause there's, too many shootings, and not enough ass kicks
Yeah, too many gangsters, and too many thugs
Too many G's too many hoods, and too many drugs
Too many mac-10's, too many techs and .38's
Not enough food, on too many plates
Too many Tony Montanas pushin a Lexus
Not enough Medgar Evers, or Malcolm X's
Too many brothers locked, in institutions
Yeah, too many problems, and no solutions
Too much, for too many people
in the thought we was all created equal
Too much, for too many people
and if things don't change there won't be no sequel
There's, too many enemies, not too many friends
Too many poor people, without too many ends
Too many politicians runnin, with too many crooks
Too many kids in one classroom, and no books
Too many broken promises, and too many lies
Too many girls buyin dreams, from too many guys
Too many young black brothers doin too many bids
Too many single black mothers raisin too many kids, alone
Too much sicknesses and too much disease
Too many genocidal blacks, too many degrees of seperation
causin too much strife
Too many things known in the ghetto that can take your life
It's too much, for too many people
in the thought we was all created equal
Too much, for too many people
And if things don't change there won't be no sequel
There's, too much pop and not enough soul
Too many things we create but we don't control
Too many people walkin round, with not enough hope
Too much crack, and way too much DOPE
Too many fathers not around, to raise their children
Too many empty lots and abandoned buildings
Too many jails bein built and not enough schools
Too many rappers ain't droppin no jewels!
Too much negativity, in the things we say
and not enough about showin us a better way
Too many young black soldiers, in too many graves
Too many of us still thinkin like slaves!
Time to break the chains and the ties that bind
and elevate ourselves to a, greater state of mind
Set some positive examples for the youth!
Teach them well so they know the truth, cause now
it's too much, for too many people
In the thought we was all, created equal
Too much, for too many people
And if things don't change there won't be no sequel
Too much, for too many people
In the thought we was all, created equal
Too much, for too many people
And if things don't change there won't be no sequel!

Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Top Dogg]
Cause I'm a baller that show no shame!

"Young G, about to set the fuckin record straight"

Once upon a time, in the place to be
On the darkside of the C-P-T
There lived a Young G, rollin weed and smog
To make the story interesting it's me, the Top Dogg
(Cindafella!) I lived in a shack with my O.G. dad
And two big homies, who treated me bad
I cooked, and cleaned, and scrubbed the floors
And I was like an errand boy runnin to the liquor store
The homies, they used to boast and brag:
"We got Chucks, and khakis that sag!"
Even worse than that, to make me feel low
They used to have me smoke stress, while they had indo
The girls used to say, "D, you're so cute
But you gets no rap with them bell bottom suits"
Well, one day, on the Avenue
There was a man, surrounded by the Compton crew
He said, "Hear ye! Hear ye! Come one, come all!
The princess is having a royal ball
If you can rap, also dress fresh
You might win a date with the ghetto princess"
Well I, ran home when I heard the whole speech
Bust through the door, straight to my O.G.
and I said, "O.G., may I?"
And before I could finish, "Hell no!", he replied (Cindafella!)
I got so mad, mad enough to blast
Even Pops was aimin for a piece of that ass (Cindafella!)
They haunted, they flaunted, they knew what I wanted
"We gon' get some hoochies," that's what they taunted
They laughed and joked; they hated on me
They didn't wanna see me fuckin up the M-I-C
So they left the crib, with a smile on they face
And as they stepped out they said, "Clean up this place!"

(Cindafella plays the game!) Cause I'm a baller that show no shame!
(Cindafella plays the game!) Cause I'm a baller that show no shame!

Now I'm standin all alone, I just got dissed
I'd smoke them all if I had one wish
But before I make my thought a phrase
There appeared the G in a puff of haze
He said, "What's up, Dogg? My name is Suge
I'm your gangsta Godfather, it's all to the good
Now I came here with the main purpose
of grantin you your fondest wish"
I said, "Suge, what's poppin dogg?  Just put me down with the Row
And I know that I can handle these hoes fo' sho'"
He waved a Cuban cigar, and before you know
My sacks of stress was an ounce of indo
My clothes transformed from rags to silk suits
And he transformed my hoopt' into a Lex Coupe
"But you must rock the mic by stroke of twelve
Or you'll turn back into your old self"

(Cindafella plays the game!) Cause I'm a baller that show no shame!
(Cindafella plays the game!) Cause I'm a baller that show no shame!

Well I hit the hoochie ball at eleven o'clock
Too flossy for the princess so she started to jock
I got to the party 'bout ten, I'd say
Hit the stage enraged and I started to rock
By eleven thirty-five, I was all in the cock (oh yeah!!)
All my homies was amazed that the bitch was mines
So I swooped to the Coupe at eleven fifty-nine
This story doesn't end with no fuckin glass shoes
All was left on the step was the rubber that I used

(Cindafella plays the game!) Cause I'm a baller that show no shame!
(Cindafella plays the game!) Cause I'm a baller that show no shame!
(Cindafella plays the game!) Cause I'm a baller that show no shame!
(Cindafella plays the game!) Cause I'm a baller that show no shame!

Cindafella! .. Cindafella! ..
.. .. Cause I'm a baller that show no shame!
Cindafella! .. Cindafella! ..
.. .. Cindafella plays the game!
Cindafella! Cindafella! .. show no shame!
Cindafella plays the game!
Cindafella! Cindafella plays the game!

Typed by: Nelson2014@aol.com

Intro:
Change style (like what?) You know. Change it. Ummhum. 
I just get in these moods man. Make it happen. 
They brought you the mood, within the music. 
Now the music within the mood.

Hook:
We're torn between the new ways of the present
Between the old ways of the past
What will be the ways of the future?
How long will the new world last?

Verse 1:
The masses are innocent to the magnificent
Atmos ? and shit my raps are significant
So I have to benefit wouldn't you?
If you had skill that other people couldn't do?
I'm putting new thought inside your mind 
Fat Jacks makes the music I write the rhymes
Tribe Unique combines to put the vision in the rhythm
It is written certain things are forbidden
I remember when a simple rhyme was a jewel
Now you gotta freestyle and act a fool
The blacker you are the better for being cool
And gettin' screwed 
And plus somebody takin' food out your baby's mouth
You make me doubt the system
When you make a world issue out of O.J. Simpson?

Hook (x2)

Verse 2:
But things are better than they were right?
They industry is flooded with rappers that were tight
But what they are now is something new 
And everybody race around for what they gonna do 
This year a new sound in the atmosphere to pick and choose
But which is whose and whose is which?
Half the people liked ya better way before ya switched
At last the task becomes a masquerade 
Cause when you pay you don't bother 
It becomes harder to stay hungary
Because you eatin', ain't keepin' the same company
You don't want any static you think it's copastetic
But that's not livin' better 
If you ain't all together (homie)
Don't let your urge go on to live right
Or get your creativity while rippin' on the mic

Hook

Verse 3:
Survin' in the land of juveniles 
I'm strivin' while I'm risin' with the brand newest style
Uh my eyes and ears are open
I'm peepin' what they actin' like
The public eats it up, they got big appetite
First page for the rage of a nation
Second page for that nation to awaken
Third page for the old ways 
Computers takin' over man but they man made
Fourth page hooray 
As told by the God Soundwave 
We shall prevail again (prevail again)
Fifth page for the alien (the aliens) 
Five years till when?...

[Hook: Ronnie Spencer - 2x]
See I'm a Texas ranger
No longer a stranger
My tab at the bar, cost more than your car
Got 500 horses, in my yard

[D-Gotti]
See I'm a Texas ranger, candy paint changer
Thoed in the game, and I don't rock no rings
Three wheel hangers, sliding through danger
Thank God, the Shop done came up
Now I'm saying blessings over lobster, and alligator tail
I'd done front an automatic, start SL
Birds on my peely pale boots, that them damn fools
Wrecking no, pull em back to life Benz Coupe
Disappearing roof, they trail me to the saloon
To have some dranks, we some cats from out the 2
Happy hour over soon, I dropped some on my tab
Give the bar tender five G's, and dab
Then I grabbed my dame, and slid out slow
'Fore I bobbed and weaved the lot, I pulled out slow
Now you know, Gott-O been thoed since the manger
But I'm blessed, to no longer be a stranger

[Hook: Ronnie Spencer]

[Tyte Eyez]
No longer a stranger, it's been 10 years in the Lone Star
I traveled from Louisiana, in a Lincoln town car
A little home sick I hit me, but right quick
I was right back in the mix, turning crumbs to bricks
Still not knowing I would be dropping hits, with Mr. Dix
He was still in Atlanta balling, that's what they called him
Penny fool back to Tex, and called that nigga D-Reck
Hooked up with P-A-T, then the Shop been in effect
Ever since I reminisce, about my G's that passed
And I continue to mash, like everyday is my last
And I know that in the long run, I might just get tired
But I'm building this empire, so my shorties can retire
At a young age done paid, dues in the great
State of Texas, coach leather  sattle on my Lexus
Don't test this 3rd Coast, born nigga or your life's in danger
With one in the chamber, I'm a Texas ranger

[Hook: Ronnie Spencer]

[Big Pokey]
I'm a T-E-X-A-S ranger
State, with some'ing in the chamber cause it's dangerous
We ain't strangers, struggling it's hard nottas
Hard blocks and drops, hard tops
Gotta get it, till my heart stop
And I'ma be here, until God set my alarm clock
I can't lie, I love my state
When I eat I flood my plate, I love my way
Every chance I get, I'ma rep for Screw
That was one of the realest, niggaz I ever knew
True to the game, real Texas ranger
Was famous, but didn't let the fame change us
We some brain stainers, you could believe that
Swang on swangas, you gotta see that
This the place to be at, why
I can't explain, it's a Texas thang

Yeah (Rem?) Yo (Yo, you hear me, kid?)
Joe, what up? (Yo, you got that for me, man?) Uh-huh
(You got me more than one) Yeah I got you 3 tickets to the game
(How's the seats) Definitely not nose bleed
(Good) Box seats, guaranteed (perfect, perfect)
(So what, same as usual then, kid) Yup
(Alright, then I see you when I see you, say no more, say no more) Sounds good

[JoJo Pellegrino] (Remedy)
We had to learn the trip so well (took it a thousand times)
Knew the ins and outs of the route (pushing through county lines)
Hustle, risking chance, occupation is ducking swine (yo, fuck the middle man)
Box the cake in like Duncan Hines (let's get this over fast)
Through my nose in grams, took a sample blast
This the shit (slid the cash across the table glass)
Flood the street like backed up sewers (stack funds foolish)
Raps much losers (jacked up whores) steaks and Peter lugers
(Texas Hold 'Em in the clubhouse) minimum bet (t-bone)
Toasting bottles to the neighborhood mobsters that soon to be home
(Break bread) Break the code of silence (break legs)
Every man eating (every man happy) well fed, plus said
(Speed limit) Route 66 (discrete whip)
With more than one set of keys in it (pack coffee beans with it)
Hand trucks, thousand pound safes weight (a NASA tour with big apes)
Pump jacks (cylinders) cakes
(Whipping through states) We sacrifice it all and bleed for that bargain price
(Cash up) Only thing receive on the arms of stripes
(Wire taps and bugs) informants get wrapped in rugs
(Local thugs) behind beer mugs (and social clubs)
Rolling dubs (that's 2 grand) the out of state connect I run
(The size of Christmas trees) purplish fuzz (yo, hit your cuz)
Three hundred fifty pound bails (digital scales that weigh whales)
Compound buckets and garbage pails
(20 clip sales) priority mail (Canada trail)
Never stale to fail product banging (like hammers and nails)
My man from Rose Bank (wild Albanian dude) holds rank (drove tanks)
Busted ATM's out of closed banks
(Home invasion) adrenaline rush, the thought of scoring
(Boom goes the door in, 3 or 4 men pouring)
This extortion (101) black mask (gloves and gun)
Reach for the stars and you done (rob you for fun)
Call it a shakedown (beasting it) yo, fuck the police and shit
(A nickel back sold in the park) we want a piece of it
(Nation wide distribution) like Caroline and Koch
(Arizonas) no pimples (thirty pound blocks)
Federal agents watch (rubberband knots) burial plots
Who gave un gats (million dollar yachts, pull out the dots)
Supply and demand (supply and demand) give up the greens
(Set up the team) this is the American dream

[Chorus 2X: Remedy (JoJo Pellegrino)]
Yo, this is real live transporting (something like a movie)
With no film edits or credits (from yours truly)
Network for net worth (clockworks, spin like the Earth)
To make money (you gotta spend money doing dirt)

You know it's hard, out here in the streets
A pity we gotta be in these streets
Haters, are everywhere
Cause shit and with somethin' deeper than you and me
It's hard, a cold, cold world
Sometimes can't even trust ya own girl
Gotta stand here and face my fears
Ain't gonna shed no more tears

I started younger than most, got turned out sellin' dope
Skippin' school to fuck bitches, carryin' guns in my coat
With dreams to sit on meal tickets, if I slang enough of this shit
Become a boss and be a made man, impossible to hit
Buy a mansion like Scarface, estate surrounded by gates
Cold killers on the payroll, 'case they come for the safe
Build a empire, they can't infiltrate
We all aspire to be kings but we could end up bein' inmates
See it ain't all peaches and cream, take a look at the game
Pour out some Hennessy and take a walk down memory lane
I lost so many homies
Chasin' this American dream for Cuban links and Lamborghinis
Talkin' ballin' supreme, look in my eyes
And you can see the pain I'm feelin' inside, look in the sky
And ask the Lord to be my strength and my guide, and wonder why?
He put us here, because the ghetto is hell, we hypnotized
It's like the Devil got us under a spell, under a spell..

[Hook: repeat 2X]
Trapped..
In this ghetto prison and I'm always
Strapped..
People are acting crazy and I can't
Relax..
I ain't gon' stress it anymore I won't shed no tears

For half my life cats been tryin' to have my life
I been, blasted twice by jealous bastards right
And I done banked more cats than niggaz done wrote raps
Done balled off dope sacks
Fell off and came back
I done knocked on niggaz' doors with straps
Split they wigs with lumberjacks
Beat they ass with baseball bats
Nigga how real is that?
I done seen a lotta sick ass shit
Quit fuckin' wit' some of my niggaz cuz they did a lot of trick ass shit
And all my best friend been gone for ten with no release, stay..
Caged like an animal 23 hours a day
They hit us up with secret indicments and three strikers
They send us everywhere from Pelican Bay to Rikers
I got, scars and stripes been scarred for life
Almost, lost my life fuckin' with faulters twice
Who can you trust? When ya best friend'll cross you up
And turn state's evidence for the deal that he cut

[Hook]

We used to stab out in my Chevy Impala, wit' no brakes
The whole crew packin' tre-five-sevens, and thirty-eights, like Doc Holiday
Bailin' from the Fifty, and barely got away
Baby G's... High speedin', sippin on Tanqueray
Tryin'a take the pain away, cuz we all in poverty
And ain't no way out but bank robberies or the lottery
I roam the block, swallowin' D, strapped with the ride low, (??)
Whatever it takes, to get the Expos and Tahoes
And only God knows, what they gon' hit us with next
They tryin'a scare us off the set, cuttin' off welfare checks
And tearin' down the projects, where niggaz grew up as Gs
And three strikes'll get ya life, in the land of the free
I often pray for paradise, for all my niggaz and me
We came a long way, we all seeds from a strong tree
But took the wrong way, the life of drug dealin' and crime
Niggaz' drugs spillin' and killin' with nines, killin' our kind

My life is trapped in these line's, that's why I'm packin these nine's
I gotta rap I ain't dyin', that's in the back of my mind
Got a strap made of iron, can't relax on his grind
Bendin' over backwards for these slackers, 'til I'm snappin' my spine
Natural high, gotta focus, on these bogus poachers
Lookin' over my shoulder, Proof get it poppin' like soda, hold up
(We nothin' but soldier's!)
Slow up
(This gun is loaded!)
Roll up
(They beefin' we leavin' 'em coked up!)
If Em say it, I spray it, if he will it, I kill it
We kill packs to get iller in Detroit, hope y'all can feel it
Real as this gun on my waistline, and woah we don't waste time
(Ja) mad he can't take a punch and 50 can take nine
We got school craft here at the 7, 8, and text her

[Hook]
I feel myself sometimes trapped in my own world
I feel myself sometimes trapped as a little girl
I feel myself sometimes knowing what way I wanna be
I feel myself sometimes filled up with envy
Cause I can't get a job, should I rob
My pockets say yes, my mind is saying you should not
But welfare ain't supporting me
And this minimum wage is just shorting me

[Verse 1]
I feel myself sometimes thinking of the crime of the crimes
These criminals got me in a criminal state of mind
And now I can't maintain, it's overcome my brain
The government is loving it when they feel my pain
Cause poverty's got our souls bleeding
And money is the key to eveybody greeding
It's 44 ways to do some dough receiving, when you's a fiend
Search for a scheme and the motherfucking green
The lute, now let me throw on my black suit
And me and my crew gon' do a robbery or two, but true
Cause if you dead I don't really care
I'm tired of being broke and fuck life just isn't fair
Now sit back and thank
Let's rob a bank
And anybody stepping in the way is gettin sprayed
Behave bank teller, where the money dwella
I'm sick of cleaning floors for stupid hoes like Cinderella
It's getting to the point where I can't deal with myself
This is just how I really feel with myself

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
It's off, how you do with your badge and suit
Wondering what the fuck I am up to, huh
Is this a friendly visit
Or am I just another black miss statistic, on your shit list
Cause when you look into my eyes can you tell
I be disguising myself, for other people's wealth
If you can't let me paint a picture of it clear
If I'm guilty no questions, lie detections
Regrets, only those who chose to cross up in my section, confession
I ain't afraid to shoot ya
Cause prostitution in the projects seem to be this bitch's only future
So put the money in the bag, don't push a button
Making false fucking moves all of a sudden
Even if I hear the wind blow
You gon' have a meeting with them nice folks, in the clouds though
For sho', I'm tired of being broke busted and disgusted
At the end of my rope, labeled as dick sucking, trick turning ho
Stealing a bunch of wallets, spreading violence, silence
Listen to the tick-tocking of the clock and
Watching the security guard attempting to play it hard
No time for fight, once we pull this heist
Trying to change my life, if the price is right
If the price is right now

[Hook] (x2)

[NOLA]
NOLA!
See that's how I be feeling sometimes
You be in another state of mind
You be trapped in your own little world
People can't understand, they wonder why you get high
You know what I'm saying you be trying to escape
Escape from reality
You know you be doing bad, your pockets broke and shit
And people can't relate to how you be feeling

(*Verse 1*)
Off the rossi twisted, I'm not yo average package
Snatch it, too bad ya had to miss it, english keeps me lifted
We can take a, one good leg to kick it
My walkin til I'm crippled, talkin sick wit it
Top of shiznit, til it get noted that I'm liquid
Quick we bustin on all you rivals
All about survival, liabale, to burn up every bible
Cuz ain't no fuckin wit my style, dial 1-800-fuck-it
Cuz I'm zoned up out my mind, 
and based on the notion that it's kill a nigga nine times
Sonic boom like Guile, Dr. Doom proper room wit space
Cuz I'm off the wall like Michael, Myers, cream like Dryers
I is, certified fifty, nifty
Won't it be one hella've sight to try an get me
Sticky as a gasimist, I be leavin clits with hickeys
English go over to mickey's
incredible like bitch be tryin to pull sixty-six point sixty
Victim full of fish, cook 'em shook 'em like yahtzee
I'm mo' hated than a nazi
Scorchin Niggaz is my posse, try to stop me

(*Chorus*)
Brotha Lynch keeps me tremendous
Tall Can keeps me tremendous
X-Raided keeps me tremendous
and these be my brothers an they keep me in this
Big Nation keeps me tremendous
Capone, and Silouette, keeps me tremendous
Annihilation keeps me tremendous
Now these is scorchin niggaz an they keep me in this

(*Verse 2*)
I got some shit to blow my mind,
that I juss can't shake,
just give me a microphone, a Phonk Beta beat
Watch me eat these niggaz up like Jason
chasin you through camp pistol lake
like a wolf on crank hit the dank,
the tank up, put on the make-up
an come back to life like Brandon Lee,
hit the corner, wit a four-four loner,
on a one way trip off that water,

Run fo yo life, the mic rock hard
I'm fuckin wit no grease no love fo the police
watch for the boner, bend over, swig the Olde E
The microphone fling, the leather chrome green
Left the scene clean, like death on halloween
Like a hollow tip, smoke somethin mean
built the mic, an the drink one for you an one for me
And call me Superflex, cuz like that mic I'm breakin necks
Run train tracks, like stand by me, lookin for any dead body,
I'm grip like a pitbull, leave yo brain gone like Muhammad Ali,
Mista Nightridah's creepin up by the minute, sky's the limit
super-duper storm trooper, gotta watch my back like Martin Luther
See me comin wit my bright lights out
Tremendous, that's what Sicx is all about

(*Chorus*)
Black flags keeps me tremendous
Dickey saggin keeps me tremendous
Beleini Way keeps me tremendous
Do or die double E, nigga deep up in this
Old English keeps me way twisted
Tequila lime keeps me way twisted
Gets me in the mood to handle unfinished biz-ness
Intoxication keeps a nigga in this

(*Verse 3*)
I mix my gin wit my Olee E, tremendous
Hit 'em all up, get 'em all up, out they suspenders
with my big bad automag, toe tag
for that meet 'em bottomless I betta be glad
I got 'em this, straight, heated glass
Drag a ninja wit my pants saggin, gaggin
I'm sick music made, sicker than a pit in shit
I'm wit Sicx, Tall Can and Fig
Dicks big, got you fiendin fo the sickness, Swartzenagger

Free weed gets me tremendous 
Juicy clits get me tremendous
Loose lips gets me tremendous
Swartzenagger an you know I'm in this
My nigga six he got me in this
Tall Cen, I told ya I'm in this
my nigga Fig, I'm glad you in this
I put that on my mama I'm a make my grip

Swartzen-nigga, all the way to represent

An ya best believe that
Swartzen-nigga, that's right give it to ya here

Copy, snipers takin their positions right now
Perimeter sealed off Sargeant Shabazz, copy
	North perimeter, movin in

I copy that, we'll be communicatin by means of morse code
Over and out

[Freestyle]
Estimated time arrival oh-three-hundred hours, we need firepower
Defcon 5, most capsized, my G eyes, with three eyes
Dip in the trenches - chemical disablin weapons authorized
Awaitin refunitive supplies
Plastique I devise, blend in disguise
Bearing camouflouge, my tactical advantage
Your body I plan to stickup...

	Phase One of our operation is now complete
	We have captured Captain Freestyle
	and we are takin him down for cyrogenic testing
	Over and out

{b.} M.I.A. (Militia Incarcerated Arsonist)

[Shabazz the Disciple]
No time to think, we on annhilations
Break, I over heard em say they had Free in the observation tank
I reached the headquarters with a vengeance
Blew the door off the hinges
Janked a soldier in his neck with syringes
Gagged him to a motherfuckin chair while shots were ringin out
FUCK Geneva Convention, we pullin fingers out
My P.O.W.'s be tortured up in Riker's
My snipers laced the base with activated time devices
Six of my militia went down to help me prisoner
I'm starin eye to eye with the enemy's commissioner
The first chance a nigga get and I'm gon' shank him
I'm told Hugh, the Arabic nigga, sayin let's take him
the only thing on my mind was reach my cousin
Thinkin Freestyle was bleedin to death, but he wasn't
Surrounded in the dark, interrogated by these agents
One arab nigga spit in my face and lost his patience
He cocked his AK and put it right inside my mouth
Started speakin if I ain't tell him the plan, he blow my brains out
I started laughin, tried to use reverse psychology
My time was runnin out, in this star chart I be a galaxy
Prayin wish me, Allah U Akbar and Ill Raheem
And then they realized we all from the same regime
They radioed for a Huey, and 7 flamed assailaints
All along the C.I.A. had us all under surveillance
We evacuated with Freestyle in nine minutes flat
a SCUD struck the Huey and we crash landed in the swamp..

{c.} Ambush

[Shabazz]
Celestial Souljahz...

[Freestyle]
Ambush, soldier brigade, strapped with chemically-laced grenades
Stomp through swamp waters, like the Everglades
Duckin chopper blades ready to deploy, fleet ascended
to twenty-thousand feet, no retreat, until the missiles deplete

[Shabazz]
Yeah, your fleet'll be wrapped, in the Phoenix formation
Civilization wipeout, chemical warfare radiation
Seven guerillas descendin out of nine Huey's
Sixty-three man militia surround perimeters of the enemy

[Freestyle]
The Prime Meridian's about to see oblivion, due to air comma
ground, and air attack, twenty-five soldiers out in Stealth bombers

[Shabazz]
The Godz Work regime movin in with odorless oxzynes
Toxoid vaccines scenes and atroplenes
Wipin out organisms in seven million mile radius
Attack my strateg and mortal remains are miscellaneous

[Freestyle]
Hittin the right coordinates to sink your battleship subordinate
In adequate conditions your position STILL unfortunate

[Both]
The ground attack, air attack, sea attack
We attack, the industry attack
Army of God invade your premises annihilate the nemesis
Fulfill the prophesies of Genesis

[Shabazz]
YEAH I march through your barracks, sprayin automatics
Hold your pawns hostage, heist all your carats
Seems your infantry eventually they sing like parrots
Spies couldn't see they own demise in the tarots
Your first platoon's D.O.A. and M.I.A.
Soldiers of P.O.W., we move like the C.I.A.
We leave no evidence or fingerprints, court adjourned
Y'all mortals better join ranks and crown the sovereigns

[Freestyle]
I cover covert operation classified information
Rollin in the form of insects with the gift of regeneration
In my oculars, night vision binoculars
Peepin it through periscope
Sittin on nuclear bombs of different isotopes
This assignment, critical governmental realignment
Total annihilation your administration's in confinement
Solitary, military...

End of transmission
This tape will self destruct, in five seconds

Album:  Defenders of the Underworld (compilation)
Song:   Trinity Lost
Typed by: moshamosha@yahoo.com

[Pep Love]
This is a terrific tale 
Of fiction and fact
Depiction and confliction, back
When your religion was original 
Didn't you know 
There was a shepherd 
He had three sons 
A herd of dirty sheep
He protected three hundred acres 
His land spanned wide
His sons divided three ways 
The night that man died
The eldest felt this 
Opportunity to rise
While the one in the middle still cried
The little one held his father's staff HIGH
Cursed the sky, kissed the ground
Shouted loud as he could "The world is mine!"
Drew a line 
Told his brothers to never cross
And they did the same
Not even knowing what it cost them

[Chorus]
Days are years
Years millennia 
Here's what your religion is
Gimme yours, gimme his
Division is wide
Trinity's lost and blind
I wanna find it 
It remind of what a penny cost

[Verse two]
The sons of the shepherd 
Separated the flock
Every day that they watched them graze 
They started to plot
Against one another 
And since the younger brother 
Dispensed with brotherly bond
And he responded swift
Speedily immediately he would lift
One of the other brother's sheep
If ever the stray they would drift
And give a gift to his self
Thinking of ruling the tribes
He would connive 
To ruin the lives
Of his own blood
As his plot increased 
The eldest grew suspicious
And learned not to sleep
The second son turned to god and asked 
"Why my brothers defy my fathers wish
And it shouldn't be like this"
But learned that's how it is
Hell bound
When he found his older brother drowned
In a well down below the pasture
Blow the horns in Zion
And warned them of the lion to come

[Chorus x2]

At any cost 
To be the boss 
The youngest would pay
His brother learned 
With his brothers death
And then turned 
To his heart 
To see if any love was left
Grabbed his staff
Gathered the flock 
And covered his chest
With steel mesh 
And searched the stretch of the land
Prayed to find his little brother 
So he could remind him
That the shepherd 
Shields the sheep from the leopard
And charged with this duty
Never kills to eat
When he told him this
His reply was that
"My father has died, 
And his land is divided
There's not enough for us, 
So it is a must 
that I make you suffer 
just because"

[Chorus]

And that day
The brotherhood between the three brothers
No longer existed
And their story lives
By themselves
Days are years
Years millennia 
Here's what your religion is
Gimme yours, gimme his
Division is wide
Trinity's lost and blind
I wanna find it 
It remind of what a penny cost

Direct respect, due to stress I almost lost my life
My baby momma so much drama I gotta pay that price
I'm a trip, I hate hoes on one hand
The other hand I want me a wife
Cop the Jag then lace her with ice
Leave the mall with bags, yeah right!
Skeet on that freak then dip the same night
Fly a kite bitch, booty colder than a ice pick
Fuck you and your best friend, I'm quite sick
Plus it's my third leg make 'em throw fits
I don't trust 'em nor love her - that's some bullshit!
Ol' girl pregnant, now she's headed
to the delivery room to have yo' baby
Dawg, that's your lady - muh'fucker you crazy!
Fuck that broad, she's shady
Aftermath bitch I'm sway-zy
How is latex lazy, that pussy had my vision hazy
But Zaire's here, my only son and baby
I mean Zaire's here, my only son and baby

Who can I trust in the end?

Fucked in the game and act like dames
Over fame just watch the change, change
Muh'fuckers so quick to blame
All the beef fly like planes, make it sayin the same
Look what +Ca$h Money+ did to B.G., Juvenile and Wayne
The root of evil with much disdain
Of course they go against the grain
to maintain, tryin to obtain big thangs
Jealousy and hunger make the tec go {*boom*}
Now you on the flo', blood leakin out your brain
Mannn, that's the way it is
That's how it be, that's how we live
Watch your back, cause these kids
tote ammo and they'll split your wig

Song:   Tryin' to Survive
Typed by: Lil Hustle

(Ronnie Spencer)
Ooooooh, yeeeeeeeah
Yeeeeah-ay, ooooh yeah

[Hook: Isis Re]
I don't know, how I can survive
In these streets, hard to be me
I can surviiiive

[Ronnie Spencer]
And I don't know how long, I can survive
Living in these streets
Puffing on these sweets, keeps me alive
And I don't know how long, I can hold on
When I look into the sky, see the birds fly
Keeps me holding on
And I don't know what to do
This life is taking me, through my up's and down's
And I can't get off this ride, holding on so tight
I just close my eyes (close my eyes)

[Hook: Isis Re]

[Z-Ro]
I had to keep from going under, like Stevie I wonder thinking hard
Running out of places to lay my head, got me drinking hard
Born struggling, a fellow achieved his bubbling
The fact that I can't get no job, don't do nothing but rub it in
I'm running out of time, and I'm sick of slanging nickels and dimes
Ducking the police daily, is affecting my grind
Losing my mind behind the wrong woman, that say she loves me
Long as I'm dropping on the rent, everything is lovely
So many features in songs, tell me why I ain't got no home
Penitentiary grown cause I roam, with a pocket full of stones
Somebody tell me, will I make it to the cream of the crop
Forever stressed, so I be screaming a lot
Dog at twenty years old, I use to know that I'd be reaching 25
Now 24 and still no do', my job is struggle and strive
I keep my heat up under my seat, when I creep
Cause I just met Mr. Sweets, but now he under my feet
Man it's a cold cold world, that we living in
Killas'll take your life, and it ain't gotta be about no divid-ends
Forgive me for my sins, I'm just trying to make it
Trying to keep my pistol from my head, cause I just can't take it
Jesus, I'm trying to survive

[Ronnie Spencer]
And I don't know what to do
This life is taking me, through my up's and down's
And I can't get off this ride, holding on so tight
I just close my eyes (close my eyes)

Song:   Tryin' to Make a Dollar Out of 15 Cents
Typed by: compbuttons@hotmail.com

[Hook x3]
Tryin' to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
How come when I was down you wasn't brown nosin'

[Master P]
See it's a fucked up life that I'm livin' in
I slang cola cause I didn't have no dividends
My baby mama stressin' she don't wanna slang dope
The ghetto's tryin' to kill me which way should I go
Now I'm on the corner takin' penitentiary chances
Even though there's marks on my turf that can't stand me
I think to myself, when should I leave
Too say fuck em' nigga till ya hit my weed
I guess I'm a G about my scrilla cause they bashin'
Crews know that P is quick to put em' in that casket
The game got me streesin' but the game gon' stress out
Even though the task just raid a nigga's house
Took a loss in the game tryin' to bubble up
Find the P deep in the grind slangin' dope fiends double ups
And pretty soon I'll be back to a whole thing
If I had to do it again I'd probably do the same thing

[Hook x3]

[RBL]
Man it ain't nothin' but a thang to let ya nuts hang
Cause in this game a million niggas tried to fuck the same thang
I know it be like on, on my block
Niggas must be on the cell while another's on the short stop
It won't stop and it won't quit
Tell me another quick way for a nigga to check a grip, shit
I'm kind of in a rush, it's kind of like a must
To get some, in God we trust
Bein' broke sure ain't no joke
I barely got enough money to buy me a whole loaf
Niggas be spendin' money like records
So I move from Mike Chester to Girbaud pocket
Cause a lesson is a nigga will shoot
No playin' hoops, he ain't gon' never see no signs or no quick loot
Dank costs ten and the drey costs five
So I gots have more in my pocket than a nickel and a dime, bitch

[Hook x3]

[Master P]
Gold fronts in my mouth, hella dope and got my bags tight
Bitches on my dick cause they know the P rags are tight
But I ain't trippin' off no hoochies with no lil' skirt
I'd rather deal with them turks, puttin' in work
They caught up in some dirt
Cause I'm the Ice Cream Man droppin' off hella loads
Vanilla, stawberry, cherry bitch I even got Rocky Road
Take yo pick, I know you dope fiends wanna lick
But that's gon' cost you twenty bones in case you wanna hit
I love you, you love me
But this ice cream don't go for free
It's a ten, twenty, fifty, hundred dollar sack or cone
And if you ain't spendin' bring yo broke ass on
Golds on my vehicle, fools they can't see me though
Tens for twenty, that's plenty meet me at the liquor store
Fiends want credit but cha' know I can't fade ya
When you get cha' cash together call me on my pager
I'm stressin' off the game, I barely gets sleep
I just had to bail my lil' partner last week
In and out of aves gettin' chased by the 5-0
Gettin' my hustle on, a way of survival
And if I get caught I got play
But I ain't goin' out without two stones to the head

Typed by: kirenamloh@msn.com

[Tupac Shakur - recorded from 1994 interview]
I'm already convicted. My whole life has been turned around
I lost every job, I lost everything, every opportunity I can get
Can't get- buy cars, can't get rent, can't get none of that
But I'm still a survivor, y'know. I'm still coming to court
Still smiling, still signing autographs, but soon I'ma go crazy!
You know what I'm sayin? And it's up to the world, y'know
America eats its babies, we- I'm, no matter what y'all think about me
I'm still your child, you know what I'm sayin? 
You can't just turn me off like that... {*echoes*}

That's all these bitches screamin that, Tupac back!

[Meek Mill]
UH! Tupac back (back!), I'm two Glocks strapped (strapped!)
Rollin down in Philly, this the new Iraq (Philly!)

It's a recession on the work, I'm screamin, "Who got CRACK~?!"
I'm sippin Hennes-SY! (Hennes-SY!) Ridin on my muh'fuckin ene-MIES! (ene-MIES!)
Slidin in the back, I'm screamin MMG! {M-M-Maybach Music}

Put my wrist on froze, presidential is gold

Bitch I'm like John Wall, 'cause I just give 'em and go!
Plottin on this new 7, I can +Picture me Rollin'+
Pockets look like they pregnant, because them bitches is swollen
Got a clip I can loan, all them snitches could hold 'em
Look at them MOTHERFUCKIN WHEEEELS~! Them bitches is stolen

[Chorus]

[Meek Mill]
Mommy a soldier (soldier!), daddy is dead (dead!)

I'm screamin, "Free my nigga Earl!"
Hit you with no hesitation, we can't even get a turn
Got my Makaveli CD and I listened then I learned
Grabbed my Mac above the dresser, my OGs' said hold it firm
I'm dreamin spittin with 'Pac ('Pac!), and cyphers with B.I.G. (B.I.G.)
Tryna send me upstate, with the lifers in bid
Had me scapin my wax, sleepin, my knife in the bed
They got a nigga on point like it's a price on my head
I'm goin MAX~!! Got me knockin suckers on they back
In these cells, raisin HELL, tryna get back to the trap
But don't NEVER get it twisted, it's Meek Milly spittin facts (Meek MILLY!)
Plus somebody said they seen it and they mean it
So they steady screamin

I like it (I like it), I really like it

I like it, I really like it..

[Hook: Isis Re - 4x]
(that's what I like), I like it I like it
(that's what I like), I like it I really really really

[D-Reck]
This what I like, big Benz with bubble lights
When the two times 10's still spin, at the light
Falling up in the club, and partying all night
Seeing all I can see, then I'm leaving with some hype
Yeah that's what I like, she the prototype
Lil' sassy but classy, with her head on tight
Big sex rapper type, go hard all night
She Creole spice, and cook red beans and rice
Yeah that's what I like, taking first class flights
Gucci frames for sight, I'm dressed in linen white
On a tropical beach, with Robin Leach rocking ice
My hustle so precise, so my cash flow nice
Riding my way, each and every day
Man I work hard, so you know how I play

[Noke D]
We parlay parlay, and me-nage
We have sex capades, for days and days

[D-Reck]
I'ma do it how it go, and you already know
Reck all about his do', I'm a money making pro
Chance taker in a show, shake the dice and let em go
Yeah I love a good woman, but I like a good hoe

[Noke D]
See I like getting money, when I'm doing a show
I might get money, when I'm doing your hoe
Cause that's the way it go, man it go down
Whole K Eastbay, speed dot com
I'm on the front line, when it's crunch time
Fourth and goal line, I'm going for mine
And my teammate playas, eliminating haters
Boys can't fade us, we the rap game Lakers
And I like that, candy on chrome
And I like that girl, you get's one stone
So come alone, pack y'all bags
Get on the flo', and dance y'all
Come on, we gon ride candy cars now
Tahoes, Cadillacs
Roof pushed back, 4's don't clack
22's, what it do I like that

[Tyte Eyez]
I'm like Willy Escabar, and John Gotti
Mixed with Frank Nitty, all in the same body
With a 12 gauge shotty, it's the Mauseburg
Down in the Dirty 3rd, we got hard and soft birds
Pounds of the herb, gallons of the syrup
My wrist and medallion, got your stallion disturbed
When I fall up in the place, she all up in my face
But I'm leaning real steady, cause it's heavy round my waist
Killa skeet taste, dump it in the Sprite
Twisting up the sticky flight, got my eyes feeling tight
Yeah that's what I like, some dime piece hype
Dub deuced outside, got them tires sitting right
On the slab back Lac truck, go on and back up
And park it by the do', in case some jackers act up
But go on press your luck, and I'ma run through you
Put a price on your head, boy and get it done to you

[Hook - 4x]

I like it, I really like it
I like it, I really really really
I like it, (you know I like it)
I like it, I really really really
I like it, (you know I like it)
I like it, I really really really
I like it, (you know I like it)
I like it, (that's what I like)

You shouldn't played wit your life and now I really want it
Ya see we're bigger than smokin blunts and on the corner

To 40 sellin, how you niggas likin me now?
Pack a Rueger P-89, gone on Carlos Rossi wine
Remember that, nigga we backed, still got money, sippin yac
Square ass niggas tip your hat

My mackin is tough in the club and I stay fucked up
Jew-el dot, iced out and the Persianly
is wrapped tight around the palm
and on my back is a hog and dem rocks
Is that what makes me? A hog and stuff?
And my motto from day one was to floss and ball
and ride and side until the wheels fall
And this is for my hogs and all my doggs

Key Kool:
Breakin' it down to the double Helix
Genetically mutated amino acid trips
Now you're in the groove like stylists 
Cause I'm fuckin' up the program like computer viruses
Rhyme piloted
By the lyrical trinity
With the Key Evidence to support abilities
Some will see
Falsely but never hear
So I back my fact with more proof to make it Everclear
For you to view right through the bull when you hear it you know
It's spirtual
Alliance 
Rhyme defiance with appliance to science 
To kill compliance and the agency
That wanna take my word of fight and make me numb
Like tryin' to mack at a convent they won't get nun (none)
One and all, all in one coexistence
Infinite 
Omnipotent

LMNO Hook:
Existence everywhere at the same time
Physically separated synchronized minds
Street, studio, stages on line
All is possible with
"All seein' retina" -Divine Styler

Evidence:
I'm never far behind
I'm never rushed ahead
I got the metronome clique inside my head
Scoped it out peeped out most of my town
Most songs got wack mixes they call the underground
Gotta express the feelings
I ain't havin' it
Like Pos K jib in the light thinkin' of stabbin' it
Skills prevail oh you possessed it? No offense 
But profess live with your mind tempted stress
? leading to other illness 
My crew Groups at my Home creatin' tracks but the Realness 
Is combinations like this
Divine Styler, Key Kool and the one Evidence
Influences are, that question they never miss
For innovative lyrics check Kris cadence Parrish Smith
Are you feelin' me? 
Raise your hands if you can get with three
Cats bringin' back Royairs type Ubiquity

Hook

Divine Styler:
Brothers everywhere exist ubiquity feelin' me
Earth Wind & Fire what I desire
Bring forth manifest dues create schools and rhyme tools
My eye force so rules superiourotic ledges move 
Space and air
I appear to be clear 
But reflect when the heat hits your shadows of fear (stratosphere)
Your into pieces my mic a fiendin' your thesis
You're just a part of me so pardon me ubiquity 
Is flippin' me
I'm teachin' me beyond the furthest reaches 
Soul control memoirs of wars and battles scars from lords 
The reward when I battle stars and self excel war for control 
I ubiquities and solidify the rhyme into a world that one mind 
Either one non material a time for the two 
With the harmonious rules 
Ubiquity is we and I creatin' rhyme history
Through the powerful and wise

Yes once again, one mo' game, in the place to be

Backed up by Jay's D
I know you really wanna get wild
I know you wanna get loose now
Ain't no shame to my game
I gotta raise the roof and that's the truth
Clap your hands, stomp your feet
Feel the power in the street
Got you comin' outta your seat
From the bottom to the top

To the bowl here we go
You know we came to play

[Duston Anderson]
In the middle of the field the stadium's packed
The crowd was roarin', the time to attack

I'm comin' round the corner for the QB	 
Can't run or hide from the take down "D"

Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

Yo, yo, yo, check it
I make the past dash for the post to most indeed
My dough speeds approve feed, what I believe top seed
I write scrolls like Judei Sensei, my tongue real sharp
On the target shit, that your mind can't shield
Most can't feel, the appeal I set upon the mass
Niggaz speakin ?, one point seven grams of vocal hash
I splash like Hank and Bank flows in many waters
Shamed your game even before the fourth quarter
My order is brief, I chant meaning for demeanor
with my cleaner outlook, my moves advancin like a rook
Took, time to design, but I incline, intertwine my
shit upon your mind, check, for my warnin signs cause
I'm a hazardous graduate of the schools of fatness
My inner flows like, water in a cactus
But y'all can't see the science in this - I'm like
the day you bought you first LP, from Kane or Blastmaster Kris
Twist trees, the ordinary nig would never toke
Well over here we catch a tree but overseas we catch a boat
I wrote these degrees for the backpacks, travellin on foot
The low Guess sag, Walkman and a notebook
and Goddesses with their ear to the norm
Cause the new generation got this whole shit wrong..

Who's the fool?  My tools only used to bring elaborate
shit on ?, activist servin my addicts (why?)
Fuck up those who dance by chance a champ be fly
Smack that ass that go by and she won't ask me why
I'm tokin never gun totin I'm potent with the word spoken
Leak the speak nigga, pass that, you're chokin
With a minimum dose, toast for taste, for your liking in advance
Enhance thoughts so, comp take a chance
In my world, only the true stand in my circumfrence
They're bumpin shit, with lyrics so much they're mad abundence
I'm like the first Dutch of your day, Sensai
I'm rallyin carry the load, as my pen explode
My tech shows no weakness, behold my uniqueness
Daily Rap News messenger, Under Pressure
I raise the stakes on fakes like chips to, a gambler
You're catchin my phrase like, I passed to Wes Chandler
My style not the R&B code, but the true category
Concoting flows in Dexter's Laboratory
Switching up styles like teams of Robert Horry
It'll take me days to tell my tales of fame and glory
Been down long roads leadin through, the Swiss Alps
where every chick in town got blonde hair in they scalp
What I'm about, is still refreshin your mind, guys are blind
cause what you find is the shit, is the downfall of rapkind
Askin the same question, all the time whassup with yo' shit?
Yo sit back and focus, beginners notice:
my speech is never an impediment
Always a step of it to show I have intelligence

Talk shit then you're quick, to get changed over
Have 'em at your crib at night and not for sleepovers
Shit, showed you I'm nice, though I ain't a pushover
I done told ya, over and over
Roll with me or get rolled over
In the wrong Rover you may flip over
Off the cliffs of Dover
Make 'em think it was the doja that made 'em {?} over
I'm takin me a spot, I'm sorry, somebody's career's over

[Chorus 2X: Shayla G]
No longer the underdog I'm for the cause
Sorry y'all wasn't involved, I evolved
And now - I'm in the booth with my cape on
And now - I'm in the booth with my cape on

[Shayla G]
Nope, no longer I'm a chicken like a capon
I'm in and out the booth easy with my cape on
So hot, that many calm me napalm
Hold me, like I was in the center of they palm
They warned all the haters and naysayers
Now invasive, in the end they all like "Hey Shayla"
Out to give, but never, pull out to get
How they used to ride me for my fits and my kicks
Now I'm S.T.O, four-four, four-six-fourth
And you couldn't pick these, with a forklift
You ain't got a shot dog, don't force it
I'm sorry you couldn't pull these, with forceps
Move on, I was past lukewarm
I don't stop, get it get it, like Luke song
Ju thought, my flow was nitro
Whatever you might know to me is micro

[Lady Of Rage]
Come on

(Verse 1)
Who talkin' smack bitch
You wanna get at this, think you need more practice
You weigh out your bracket, I rock the home of fuckin' atlas
Save that racket for the tennis court inner
Bought your mission
Resort to kissin' these gluts, or you played like flutes
Cause the acne that I inflict, causes tragedy when I spit
And if you ain't the shit, you better dip, you better split
You better take off, before I before break off
Make off
Munch through cupcakes, that's soft
That's why I serve you like a bake off
I'll rip your Face Off like I'm
Nicholas Cage
You wanna face off?
That's ridiculous, I'm Rage
The mic brawler
The night crawler
I smoke 'em like I'm off that water
Clever Adlas great grand daughter
Would injure ya, your girl from Virginia (Uh, uh)
Make no bones about it
When it's all about it
I got a knights that remains raw, a ice's never thaws
Priceless, baby, hah
Rage, that's all

Chorus: DJ Premier
{*scratching*}
"Check the flow" --> Da Brat
"Rage in effect"
{*scratching*}
"So now you know"
"Kick up"
"Dust"
"As I begin to bust"
{*scratching*}
"Back on up" --> Lady Of Rage

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 2)
I'm foldin'
Emcees like Times with dirty consonants and vowels
When I creepin' on the prowl and stay wild out like an owl
Now who (Who)
Flows better than this rhyme writer
You in a click full of dicks and you still couldn't come tighter than
Live in red dress
With the afro puff hairdress
Young and restless, naw, you nah wanna test this, ha
I break it down baby, and best pray to the Lord
Cause
Fuckin' 'round with Rage is a
Wish you can't afford
I leave 'em standin' on they tippy toes, dealin' with a drippy nose
Bombardin' with my fifty flows, I ain't fuckin' with these silly hoes
Now
Shit's about to get so retarded
I just got dumped and I got left broken hearted
I ain't got shit to lose, the first bitch that move
They gon'
Catch it in the worst way
Rage blood thristy
Attacks ready to throw down, that's how it goes down
I can't slow down
Judge Joe Brown convicted me a rhyme
Slaughter
Cause I spit killable syllables
Leave 'em pitiful, the cynical Rage, unfuckwitable

Repeat Chorus Twice

(Verse 3)
Now with my Timbos
I could leave a bimbo in limbo
Make 'em tremble when I spit through the dental of these instrumentals
When I'm chewin' on a mental, (???) from the intro
I told y'all from the get-go, I rock harder than credentials
Say that
Shit for your colon
I strike 'em like I'm bowlin'
You sweet cheeks can't compete with the heat that I'm holdin', ha
Dingbats, better take their wings back and cash in
Lyrical murderer back up in this bitch to bashin'
So, ante up and pull your panties up
And call your granny up
Tell her you got your fanny bust
Weak shit banged off the backboard
How about some hardcore?
How about some rough, rugged and raw
With all sincereness
I spit lyrics with raw severeness
Gladiator fearless, Tyson style, leave 'em Earless
So
Which of you, want me to snatch you by your brithces, boo
I, hit you with my witches' stew, turn 'em into bitches' brew
Terror, when you up against Rage Hitchcock
From H block
With a flow that make 'em scream, "Rage, stop!"
Now that's crazy
Naw, that's the Lady Of Rage (Rage...)

(Yeah)
(United we stand, divided we fall)
(It ain't just a song)
(It's a way of life)
(Realize)

[Daizer]
They say my skin is my sin, so I'm destined for hell
It's a game I can't win, but yet they claim this is fair
Guilty since my birth, at times I feel I'm cursed
And brown against brown, that shit's even worse
I'm Latino and proud until they put me in the ground
And right now and forever my pride is holding down
There are plenty to say, and fake it take it for granted
When it comes to showing heart, not to many standing
In and out of jail, that's the life I've been granted
Where the only justice that I know is poetic Janet
Bandits all around, all they want is get at me
Haters getting popped like you do to rid acne
There are plenty listen, but never hear what I'm saying
Claiming brown and proud, when truthfully you're hating
White washed individuals selling out like silly hoes
Calling me a wetback for my culture language that I know
Fluently in Spanish digo y ago lo que quiera
Never causing static but I'm down for whatever
United is a dream that at times I seem to have
Being brown as you're family
United we stand

[Chorus]
United we stand, divided we fall
Stand tall brown and proud I'm saying it loud
United we stand, divided we fall
Stand tall brown and proud it's on you, you make the call
(Repeat)

[Daizer]
I speak more knowledge than a teacher; hold your attention like a preacher
You're mind is like an atlas, that's why I'm here to teach you
Reach out and touch someone like AT&T
Someone had to put it how it is, that someone is me
Ignorance and jealousy usually fills our heads
Competition to the top, on each other we step
Maintain a rep always claiming, down for the bammer
When Latinos try to rise, you're the first to bring us down
You're born in the states, doesn't mean your ass is better
Let the truth be known, we're all fucking hueros
It just so happens your family beat mine to the punch
Crossed the border sooner, a matter of time separates us
Don't cuss, the truth hurts, take it like a man
Understand my plan, if offended I don't give a damn
I'm thinking about this problem cause its real
And dreaming about having peace without having to pack steal
But gang members don't seem to understand
I need no hood to back me up
I stand alone, like a man (ohh)
No need to claim and die for a street I'll never own
Run around like a kid, when I know I'm full grown
You're just doing them a favor when you're killing one another
Think, who would have your back if the shit came down to color
Feel they know some project claimed, one street in this land
We could own the world if united we stand

[Chorus: 2X]

(Yeah)
(United we stand)
(Remember that)

Song:   Untitled *
Typed by: JubeiUno@aol.com

* yes, the actual name of the song is "Untitled"

I wondered the fields and listen for the sound of drums
The colder the ground becomes the closer I get I home
The planets not fit to roam but with all the chaos
But, when I saw the savages I played the law of averages
And when the river splits in half, I start to lose my wits and laugh
And cry at the same time, there's nothing I can do about it
Even though I wouldn't doubt it, if the winds began to blow
And carry the sounds of my voice to the lands below
So I put my hands around my mouth and hollered to the sunken city
That, wallows in the filth of its own drunken pity
And wait to see a signal but a signal is never seen
Eventually fatigue builds inside me exponentially and so I sleep
And dream that I'm able to FLY they will respect a man with wings!
Later I awake, in agony and learn 
That while I was sleeping the city had burned
Shrugging my shoulders, I paused and gathered thoughts
Think twice about staying put, then decide I rather not
So I press on in my agnostic pilgrimage
Knowing that I can swim deeper than the grim reaper
Ready for whatever sea creatures may abound
When the water swallows me and not the other way around
Survival saw me through the mechanical district
Starvation lays to bay cannibalistic
I have to rely on cons and silence and on talking quick
Defending myself with nothing but this walking stick
I've never had friends and no parental guidance 
I'm wild at heart and weird on top, I'm feared nonstop 
Even though my rage is worn out
My life's a book with several pages torn out
I just, climb trees and look for rhythm everywhere

I used to be the town crier in a city of stone throwers
Until my soul was laid bare and displayed in the pearled square
Ignored, more than a lot, not less, no one understood my thought, process
I was gagged and bound over noise complaints 
But, commanding the resolve that destroys constraints
I, found my escape in a melding of memories
The next thing I know, I'm rowing this boat 
And blowing this note on an old tarnished trumpet

Ever since then I've been wondering lots
Watching the sky and pondering thoughts
Strange angel, music box genie
Behind for sometime and now I'm blind in one eye
And how this happened exactly will never be known

My thoughts take the shape of the hang-mans house
Never fails in time traveling salesman visit

Up all night
Oh, yeah
Haven't felt your love for some time now
Damn, I miss your lips next to my mouth
And I can't wait to make up for the lost time

Cause without you here
I'll probably never sleep
I look in the mirror
Your face is all I see
I want you on my pillow
Give me your love
I can't breathe
Baby, come here
So I can go to sleep
You keep me up all night
Whoa yeah

No shut eye
Can't even sleep a wink at all
I can't lie
You've given me insomnia
Now I can't wait to make up for the lost time

Cause without you here
I'll probably never sleep
I look in the mirror
Your face is all I see
I want you on my pillow
Give me your love
I can't breathe
Baby, come here
So I can go to sleep
You keep me up all night

Whoa oh
You keep me up all night

Vice (4X)
	You have the right to remain silent
	Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law
	You have the right for an attorney
	If you do not, or cannot afford an attorney
	an attorney will be appointed to you - you are now under arrest

Crime, it pays real nice
But what you really didn't know that crime pays twice
It pays once in money, twice in years
in the jail cell, tryin to hide your tears
And the trip bad, cause you tried to get rich
in the graveyards, or in the shallow ditch
It's money or time so make up your mind

Vice (6X) [Miami!] Vice, Vice 
Vice (6X) [Miami!] Vice, Vice
Vice (6X)

Fraud, the girl he adored
Turned out to be another dirty old broad
Took all the money, told all the lies
I heard she even, slept with other guys
Nothing she wouldn't do for a dollar or two
But every lie she told he knew to be true
He loves his honey, but she loved money
	Vice (6X)
Talk about ya-yo, uhh, it's everywhere you go
They said in Miami it'll never snow
Now it's snow in the palm trees, snow on the sand
It snows all day, for sixty dollars a gram
Now they're strung out and high, hung out to dry
The air that they breathe the food that they buy
They think that they can fly, but that's a white lie

Vice (6X) [Miami!] vi-vi-vice, vi-vi-vi-vi-vice [Miami!]
Vice (6X) Vice, Vice
Vice (6X) Vice
Vice (6X)

The mob, a full time job
Known to extort and steal or rob
Started as a hitman, lookin for wealth
And now he's the boss workin for his self
For all the blood money that he did earn
It made him take lives with no concern
But soon he would learn that next is his turn

Prostitution, it's a low down shame
How any girl, would wanna play that game
From pillow, to post, a sidewalk host
But the lady's got a condo out on the coast
She thought that the hole, was better than gold
Now she worked on her back til she got too old
Layin down on the job, has made her a slob, uhh
	Vice (6X)
It's a stickup, so throw your hands in the air
And don't, ah put em down, keep em way up there
Just let me your wallet empty all your pockets
Got a itchy trigger finger and I'm gonna cock it
My eyes got wide as they pulled away
I said, "Who are you the cops?"  He began to say
"No I'm Clint Eastwood, make my day... get in the car!"

Homicide is on the rise, and it's no surprise
The bums are in the alleyways tryin to take lives
People burglarize then suicidal criminals are never idle
Court procedures at your leisures eight finger Visas circle seizures
Con man fencer, arson is a trip
Take all the fingerprints, and give him the book
And then hope that the judge don't let him off the hook, uh!

Dipper A-Low:
I suplex the mind with a rhyme that can outrun space and time
Genuine since 89
My hip hop percise with a verbal connectic sixth sense 
Sa lyrical  barracks for ya has beens 
Mentally crappin' out in a deadly game of snake eyes
One die bring fries heres a new salt for that 3rd eye 
Flavoring additive no artificial primative 
Your lucky God was on your side to say "Just let him live" 
No partner interprise that wack shit build a wack skit 
And watch you get that ass whipped 
I'm rippin' the tips off of girls clits and leavin' 'em hangin' 
The west is lyrical gang bangin' 
Changin' your viewin' aspect of what's playin' cause I'm Dipper 
Different and significant vocal instrument 100 percent intelligent 
It's irrelevent those false alligations by my idiot nation 
Who was born in the suns vibration twisting and blazin'
Caught up in my text and it's amazing 
Seeing your cerebrum brazing along the hot black asphalt 
Through to a stalk as your every night sleep 
I watch you walk through hell with a perm 
And watch you burn like Howard Stern in the midnight 
Devils catch beligerant significant

Hook: Vocal instument vocal instrument
We're different but significant (X2.5)

My voice travels like current words shock like voltage 
Deadly component sealing your fate as i detinate 
Feel the imination from the golden state 
Awaking those who slept I even get props from the depth 
Now watch my tango with the bass clef 
Clever in every measure studying depth and still misteps
On routines I never flow rountine 
Only those slogans are spoken by the token that's tokin' 
I stay tokin' cause I'm definatly different 
From those who act cold and sell their soul in an instant 
Some rappers auras cause bad karma 
Fakes and industry snakes dance cause labels are the charmers 
The way some act is insulting
I boo wack acts cause that could be mycontract 
No tact just a waste of a phat track
and even with wack tracks you're still selling millions

Lyrical orhtodontics will extract your tricuspid 
Cuts hit percise cause my mind is on target 
Or should I say tarshae you got Irish Spring 
This is lyrical Oil of Olay I don't play 
I'll intoxicate like Tanqueray
represent hip hop or don't step into L.A. 
Or you'll be a victim of mental decay 
I'll mind fuck you then toss your brain matter away 
I'll slay any fool that doesn't obey 
Slap your moms then hold your whole crew at bay 
Bite a Don then drink my lines like fine wines 
E equals an MC who's square my logics like Einstein 
Blowing up shows like explosive 
In a cave where flows live banished becasue they're too corrosive 
In your ass 
Like bacteria your rap application didn't have the right criteria 
Some rappers just aren't significant 
But I'm fitted and designed to signify my vocal instrument

Children locked in, stone that's deep
Anything to, break the will
Ask and receive, baby
Love is what we need, baby
Love will make it right
Evolution of, you and I
Ask and receive, baby
Love is what we need, baby
Love will make it right
Evolution of, you and I

I'm breakin through, every wall I see, dividin
Can't keep me from mine, best believe, see me risin
Can't let no one take control of the soul I believe in

And these are my, little chains
Entertwining, confining, confined

Ask and receive, baby

As Vinia Mojica delivers her siren song
Forgive me if I hear wrong, I don't think that I belong
in a security prison system that reads maximum
Deprived of what man needs most, social interaction
when I got locked up, for a series of events occuring
Now I'm somewhere between a slave and indentured servant
C.O.'s hate me, rehabilitate me?
They don't want me released back on the streets seein my lady
Questionin the mystery of life and how I should lead it
It wasn't in books, I couldn't study it or read it
I'ma tell you a secret if you promise to keep it
For now I realize the love was all that I needed

Ask and receive, baby
Love is what we need, baby

[C.A.L.I.B.E.R.]
I was feeling under the weather
Spot sunshine, sundress with a shot glass, one lime
I'm usually confident
Beautiful made me kinda' timid so I raised up
My blood alcohol percentage and I represented
Hesitant to grab her arm
Looking like a vagabond Caliber kills her with the charm
As compensation for the cash flow
I approached the honey mad slow
Hoping in a moment we could dance slow
But before I could advance yo she said no
Mumbling something about the club scene and assholes
[I] stayed humble, extended my hand
[She was] so receptive to the fact when I approached her I was such a gentleman
[I] told her that's just how I am
Would you consider this dance?
[She] said, "My skirt's too short, maybe if I wore pants
Plus the heels, make it harder to move."
Told her, "Disregard the feeling, only part required is your waist to groove."
[She] grinned slightly.  Feeling she begins to like me
I converse politely hoping she'd invite me but
Instead, I got a hole in my head
Something bout' getting out of bed and dreading work because
Her boss makes her fed
Dead the conversation
Had to see if she was with it, then within an instance
I began to feel resistance
Didn't budge, I got bored
Lunging for the dance floor
She's indulged in conversation, that's not what I'm here for
Therefore
I said, "I'm about to slide, I get the picture."
She said, "I don't wanna' dance but it's nice talking with ya."
Look, clubs are for dancing
Coffee shops are for discussion
And if we party now maybe tomorrow we could luncheon
Involuntarily I move when I hear the percussion
Man! Stand still, paying twenty bills for nothing
Out of the question
Irregardless of your beauty you're making me regret that I said pardon of
excuse me
(Truly) your beauty's dazzling but I'm about to peel
Too elegant to sweat is something
Caliber could never feel

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Dressed to kill, low cut chest revealed
Classy still you've got a lot of sex appeal
But you're such a Wallflower you could dance in heels
You're trying to chill, I'm trying to see your dancing skills

[Quartermaine]
Listen sugar peeped your style a mile away
Gracious I might say exotic like a wild bouquet
I only need your time of day and maybe a
Few seconds to display the game (huh)
Not in the mood?
In the cut you claim you want to lay, but
I don't play this game to lose
Q don't run away (NAW)
I move with a straight approach, laced in [po]lo
B-boy arrogant pose
Trying to get the last drag off the hash in the roach
My wardrobe, it shows that I ain't trying to boast
But hopefully you and me we get to whine real close
Most of the time I play it cool
Don't even sweat these shorties cause
Sometimes you wave hi they think you're getting naughty
But you Miss, you're unlike all these little girls that bore me
I'm trying to get you off the wall and get on the floor see
It's curiosity that's got this cat frisky
Hot under the collar feeling tipsy off the whisky
Maximum return on my interest cause my business never risky
[I'm] spitting in tongues until you get me
Why don't you let me gently hold your hand sexy
And spin it out [of] control like a 430SC?
I think I see a spot in the corner
Where we can work it out sweat dripping like sauna
I wanna' push your body to the limit
Repetitions… infinite
We gonna' dance or not?
Let's rock before the song finish

[Chorus]

Bass! 
(Oooh White...White) 3X

Verse One:

(Ooooh...White Lines) Vision dreams of passion
(Blowin through my mind) And all the while I think of you
(Pipe cries) A very strange reaction
(For us to unwind) The more I see the more I do
(Something like a phenomenon) Baby
(Tellin your body to come along, but white lines...blow away)
(Blow! Rock it! Blow!)

Ticket to ride white line highway
Tell all your friends, they can go my way
Pay your toll, sell your soul
Pound for pound costs more than gold
The longer you stay the more you pay
My white lines go a long way
Either up your nose or through your vein
With nothin to gain except killin your brain

(Freeze! Rock!) 4X
(Blow!)

(High...) Higher, baby
(High...) Get higher, baby!
(High...) Get higher, baby!
And don't ever come down! (Freebase!)

Verse Two:

Orang dang diggedy dang di-dang
Orang dang diggedy dang di-dang
Orang dang diggedy dang di-dang
Diggedy dang di-dang diggedy dang di-dang

(Pipe line...) Pure as the driven snow
(Connected to my mind) And now I'm havin fun, baby!
(Pipe cries) It's gettin kinda low
(Cause it makes you feel so nice) I need some one-on-one, baby
(Don't let it blow your mind away) Baby
(And go into your little hideaway cause white lines...blow away)
(Blow! Rock it! Blow!)

A million magic crystals, painted pure and white
A multi-million dollars almost over night
Twice as sweet as sugar, twice as bitter as salt
And if you get hooked, baby, it's nobody else's fault, so don't do it!

(Freeze! Rock!) 4X
Rrrrah! (Blow!)

(High...) Higher, baby
(High...) Get higher, baby!
(High...) Get higher, baby!

(Turns you on) You really turn me on and on!
(Cause you gotta come down) My temperature is risin
(When the thrill is gone) No, I don't want you to go!

A street kid gets arrested, gonna do some time
He got out three years from now just to commit more crime
A businessman is caught with 24 kilos 
He's out on bail, and out of jail and that's the way it goes, rrrruh!

(Cane!)
(Sugar! Cane!) 2X

Athletes reject it, governors correct it
Gangsters thugs and smugglers are thoroughly respected
The money gets divided, the women get excited
Now I'm broke and it's no joke it's hard as hell to fight it, don't buy it!

(Freeze!) Huh-huh huh huh! (Rock!)
(Freeze! Rock!) x3
Rrrah! (Blow!)

(High...) Get higher, baby

(Pipe cries) A very strange reaction
(For us to unwind) The more I see the more I do

(Something like a phenomenon) Baby
(Tellin your body to come along, but white lines...blow away...)

Little Jack Horner sittin on the corner with no shoes and clothes
This ain't funny but he took his money and sniffed it up his nose!

Dealer:  Hey, man. You wanna cop some blow?
Junkie:  Sure, watcha got? Dust, flakes or rocks?
Dealer:  I got China White, Mother of Pearl...I reflect what you need.
Junkie:  Well yeah, well let me check it out, man. Just let me get a freeze.
Dealer:  Go ahead, man. The stuff I got should kill ya...

Song:   Wake Up
Typed by: davpaul@dove.net.au

The black man in America is blind
Don't know who he is and he don't know the time
He's in the dope game with the caine and the crack, got a gat
20 sack, Benz and a Cadillac like a mack
Uhh, like a mack, uhh, like a mack
We're steady bein pimped like a trick by the devil
And doin it cos he think he can't escape from the ghetto
But if he only knew that he was a pawn in the game
Bein use to killers, people puttin that evil in they veins
He's makin them some money but it ain't funny, is it?
I wonder if he knows he's slangin that cocaine for the Grand Wizard
of the Ku Klux Klan, cos like we told you
and add it up, Uncle Sam don't give a damn
Sellin you the powder, now can you tell me how tha
hell you expect to excel
by killin the black for the green, got the white man havin fun
Givin up the machine guns
Watchin us kill each other
Fightin over *?Parkay?*, they're scared of the real butter
So don't shoot another brother today but
point that AK at the wicked wicked USA
Cos they the ones who put me thru slavery
And now them Gz wanna give them D's what they gave to me
So can you see where we're comin from?
It's just another way to try to keep, us, blind deaf and dumb

Chorus:

Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up - To the Eastside
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up - To the Westside
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up - To the Northside
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up - To the Southside

X-N, once again, has the flow, tellin Pharoah
to let the so-called negro G-O
Cos yo, we believe the way they treated us was evil
And they never should've messed with the chosen people
Now this is the time in history for the separation
between the two nations
And they can't fade me cos God made me
to be a X-N-I-double G-A-Z
Lazy and crazy was the way they gave thee
Raise black babies ever since the day we
was bought here in chains, over nine thousand miles
Our bodies stacked and packed in big black piles
They broke us down in the Carribean
We knew sometin wasn't right about that pale-faced European
Livin anyway in sophisticated bondage
Dyin everyday over nothin but nonsense
It's gettin worse and I don't know if it'll ever stop
Mo' brothers gettin peeled, mo' brothers gettin popped
It ain't hard to tell, yeah
that a white man's heaven is a black man's hell
So can you see where we're comin from
It's just another way to keep us all, blind, deaf and dumb

Chorus

Now to the blind brothers without the power of sight
The rhyme shines bright in your mind with divine light
Deaf are the rhymes, can't hear because they fear
the sound of two X, records in they ears
And they lack the power of speech
And each time they greet or teach, they words can't reach
The gangbangers, or the drug dealers
So we grill the real deal wit skill until they feel us
Droppin this line, like bombs
>From Elijah, Mohammed and Farrakhan
The enemies wanna flex but can't win
They scared of the skin of a million black, men
In black suits and bow ties
Boots gotta spit shine, on the front line and organized
Next to us, a million black women
Soldiers, the battle ain't over, it's just beginning
No time for laughter in the last chapter
Just told of disaster of the slave master
And now we have to pay
for the masquerade, and the track we lay
For every slave, back in the days, his wicked ways
kept us in a mental grave and in amazement
But now it's a brand new day and time
And black people gotta brand new frame of mind
So can you see where we're comin from?
It's just another way to try to keep us all, blind deaf and dumb

Song:   Walk Out On Me
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Don't look at me that way
Like you know how it's going to end
'Cause I'm too tired to be honest
And I'm too hurt to pretend
Darling, some wounds will not mend

Walk out on me, walk out on me
I'll see you for the last time
Walk out on me, walk out on me
I'm giving you a life line
Just say so long and then walk away
Say so long and then walk away

We tried our best to do this
We're hanging there for awhile
But love can't live on a promise
There was means to [?]
Darling, this is our last goodbye

Walk out on me, walk out on me
I'll see you for the last time
Walk out on me, walk out on me
I'm giving you a life line
Just say so long and then walk away
Say so long and then walk away

Walk out on me, walk out on me
I'll see you for the last time
Walk out on me, walk out on me
I'm giving you a life line
Just say so long and then walk away
Say so long and then walk away

(speaking)
Uh! Watch your step!  It's no joke out here, watch your rep!

Ain't no joke to provoke a top seed
For those who smoke and they got they own weed
Ain't no walk in the park where I'm from
Dogs that bark, but they talk with they guns
Wasn't no unlocked doors where I stayed
Too much trust in the cops, you got played
I'm that spade in the deck to cut loose
Be that blade in your neck, give respect due
You didn't expect me to get this far
Now they caught the vapors, thought they learned from Bismark
This dark track could eclipse the sunrays
Hit hard raps, we should quit the gun-play
'Cuz ain't no fun to relay the bad news
Our sons and nephews know that cash rules
For it I'll never sell the soul of Ab Rude
A poet of ever'one to tell the sad truth like

(chorus)
The Undi-Sputed, Heavyweight, Rudest
Pa-rum-pa-pom!  No jargon, could ever dead, this yard mon! (Yard mon!)
Inside, outside, all sides
Seal the perimeter!  I'm a lion of the pride
His tribe, my tribe, your tribe
I put it into ya!  Warlords of the Flies

Only 9-1-1's a joke here
Cops don't come till machine gun smoke clears
Show no fear in your heart to get tested
Go nowhere in the dark unprotected
As if I gotta remind you how hectic it is
We all have homies that set-trip
They'll call for medics when the gats unleashed
You'll regret it if you don't make it back in one piece
That's how they do it no resolving the beef
Why Battle Axe Crew stays armed to the teeth
Comin' at you with them tattood physiques
So if you rap weak, better take a back seat
This is a beat that's haunting in sleep
It could bump in your jeep, what they want from the street
You could never be measured as this rude
Meet me up at the session to get schooled by

The Undi-Sputed, Heavyweight, Rudest
Pa-rum-pa-pom!  No jargon, could ever dead, this yard mon! (Yard mon!)
Inside, outside, all sides
Seal the perimeter!  I'm a lion of the pride

Lateef: Rivetin' worldwinds rippin' the world 
women and children wait a minute we're all in jeapordy(2x)

Chorus 2 (said along with chorus 1 repeat 1x)
The rains incessant prattle rides restless in the saddle, 
a land of a million horses power trotting to the pattern

The rains incessant prattle 
marches on & on & on & on & on & on & on &on

[Lateef]
It began at sea
Three cross currents concurrently
Creating the mother of all tempests to be
Enter percipitation and Ioniozation
The cloud cover hovered 'round ten thousand feet
They sent it swiftly to meet 
The oceans waves peaks
Along the jet stream 
Bars of fog sparkin', rollin, and pourin
Needles of rain
Thunderin' like god bowlin' lane

[Lyrics Born]
Crashing and Clapping
The master craftsman passionately 
Expressing his anger as angst
And flashes of rain
Insanity and fascinating
Irrationally lashing out
Fashioning from his magesic means
Patters and waves
Gravity couldn't tame
Battering seas with scenes
The skies were stained 
With the light white panes 
of lightening veins
By the grey clouds
With grey silk ingrained

Devastatin'(2x)

Devastation(1x)

[Lateef]
The Baltic, Bulboous ,Cumlous
looked more like swabs of cottoon in a charcoal dip
Stretched across all four tips of the horizion
Yet it's movement was swift
But there seemed to be a shift
The squall paused
With an oddness and stillness that felt
....Ominous

[Lryrics Born]
Now if the storm was the servant
And near the earths surface
the congregation was stirrin', nervous, swervin'
like a burnin' furnace yearnin'
It was churnin', peturbed
And quite determined to be heard
[Begin alt w/Lateef]
so the ocean floor burst
The earthquake merged
And formed a network of cooridors
Which made the earth porous
The forch surged forth
The surf roared
And the stormin surf above
It assumed the same course
Now the rain poured water
And the basin toward corners
And they both aimed toward the northern Califorina Shores
And as the wind whispered warning 
The ground hinted authority
The long shoremen lean 
Foreward oars
Lower corner
It's quadruples in proportion
He was floored 
By his formal introduction to the force!

Devastatin'!

Riveting whirlwinds Chorus (3x) 
  at the same time Rains incessant pattern Chorus(4x)

[Lyrics Born]
That afternoon the appatite of the catasrophe beast cooled
Began by snackin' on the panoramic view
Population of people 
Every single house was feeble 
In the eye of mouth of the storm
The needle of the richtor scale teeterd and trembled
So beautifully warm, Picturesque
Hail shot through the window ceil 
The glass splinters sailed
Through the innards 
Of little Children
Waitin for dinner
They entered and exited
The earth split like god flesh
And them engulfed two whole blocks
The roofs blew off like screw off tops
The school of the arts, the schooner docks
Plus huge supermarkets
and all its human contents
Uprooted and scooped on top 
Like Duplo blocks
Now few alive to announce
the true accounts what really amounts
To rumor mills spouted huge amounts and dollar damage
The doom, the trials, the tribulations
Who can do with out the balance between life and total devastation

[Lateef]
Everything aroound you shakin'
And you quakin'
And you feel the rockin of the foundation
Is made a slave to vibration
Then down you go 
Your minds been slow 
Around you so
Dishes flying out of the kitchen cabinet do'(door)
A few crashin' when they smashin' the windows
Thats when you recognize isn't just the terror in your eyes
or the fear between your ears
It's the thunderin' and the rumblin'
Is it over you're now wonderin'
That's when the telephone poll
rips through the roof
And adds the wide stake to your livin' room 
Natures heavy burden is now pass along to you
Your house heaves and pulls 
You watch the house next door 
swallowed by a sinkhole
It's outta coontrol,  whoa!

Rivetin' worldwinds rippin the world, 
women and children wait a minute were all in jeapordy(2x)
The wind brought the rain, the rain cleared the lane, 
and still made room for more rockin'
The quake shook the state, the state took the bait, 
and sank, and still made room for more rockin (echos)

[Alt w/Lateef, begin Lyrics Born]
It's like the bible says
The Final days
the tidal wave
The earth to quake
The storm to raise
Simultaneously
Smack the land mass 
bordering 
Cal-i-for-ni-a
The pourin' rain 
The Smoke and flame
The earth a gaping opening
From growin' pains
Broken main regurgatitin'
Automatin' 
Pain
You're off and daughter screams in vain
The black became a rectangular lake
Some people greivin', neighborhoods that hydroplane
Heaven heavin', kept repeatin'
Passenger and everybody try to escape 
on half a tank
hearts palpitate
valves breakin
Cal state 
Fault line
Open wide 
Ya fall flyin'
Clothesline
(??) car
Blindsided by a semi
fallin'
cascadin'
golden gate
girders
following you
spiraling down the hemmoraging falls

Uh. Uh-huh
You love me?
You love me not?

When it comes to girls ya'll
I don't trust em hell nahh
Stay arguing and bitchin'
So much better in the kitchen
You give em a half an inch
You'll have you sittin' the bench
you try to throw her a bone
She'll try to move in your home
Ain't nothing good bout her but the d cups
That's exactly why I keep the toilet seat up

Girls ain't nothing but trouble
Can't live with em can't love em
Can't live without em can't trust em
Its a war of the roses man cuff em
Girls ain't nothing but trouble
Can't live with em can't love em
Can't live without em can't trust em

Tell myself that I will keep my distance
Hard to mix a pleasure with a little business
Nut she was kissing other guys with lipstick
That's exactly why I'm so damn chauvinistic
Cuz i take baby oil and oil her down right down
Your ass ain't loyal I heard Chris Brown get down
they ain't good for nothing but layin' on their back layin' on their back
they ain't good for nothing but layin' on their back layin' on their back

Girls ain't nothing but trouble
Can't live with em can't love em
Can't live without em can't trust em
Its a war of the roses man cuff em
Girls ain't nothing but trouble
Can't live with em can't love em
Can't live without em can't trust em

Girls ain't nothing but trouble
Can't live with em can't love em
Can't live without em can't trust em
Its a war of the roses man cuff em

Can't live with em can't love em

We got what you want

We got what you need all night (all night)

{Yo we came wid it, we came wid it}

[Maestro]
I'm like the honorable Allajah, Mohammed
I throw knowledge, my flow solid, poetry so polished
Hit the 3 with 60, flowing infinitely
I got to get mine, Lockdown's rolling with me
Selling smash in the set
From Cataract to Quebec
You jepardizing like you're Alex Trebek
The penetration of my rhyme is like a hollow head
Your head's hollow, brothers wilding
I'm guiding your lift, making you follow
Ain't no stopping me or blocking me
I made the trigger fornicate with the nometry
Shining astronomically
I serenade with black roses
Spit explosives, you can't approach this
I leave your coma where your toes is
Rappers are hopeless, I told you stick to your vision
But the devil made you lose your focus
You didn't notice, this is T-Dot to Lebanon
Forever strong, we seperate your head
From you arm leg leg arm

CHORUS

[Infinite]
Yo, you first hear speaking, you ward(?) like wrong reason
Hold decent, grey smoke like clothes reakin
Hill beaken, like them hollow pipes leaking
Foreworks get lit up like long weekends
Some get hit with life trageties
And develop a gangster mentality, salute to my family
I'm long taking, bigorous like bloddy aprons
Boast with your own dose to tell your own people adios
That ice with your sleeve on it and that chain with your name on it
Light up the sky with your brain on it
It's all that I know, so that the way I come on it
It's all that I know, so you could put my f***ing name on it

Album:  Eminem Presents The Re-Up
Song:   We Ride for Shady
Typed by: Nickolye16@aol.com 

[Obie Trice]
We run this shit, fo'-five on the hip
Been ridin for Shady, Shady {*echoes*}

[Ca$his]
Geah, Ca$his know
Shady Records, the dream team, uh

Sittin in the back of the, all-gray Acura
Gun to the passenger for actin tough
Turn the wheel in the passin, heart of an assassin
Plus I'm on the draw down, quick as fuck
Last move 'fore I give all street shit up
Put a nigga in the ground face down, feet up
This nigga here tried to cuff me for my re-up
When I went to his crib he called police up
Now you on the way to bein paraplegic
for sendin messages through bitches like you go see us
Shady, Ca$h king of the dope fiends plus
Give 'em a square mile by blocks and I'm creamed up
Took the bullet out of Obie head, put it in my pistol
and use it, ammunition on the niggaz they hit
Damn, I go to war on the regular man
Cause I'm part of the dream team, you a regular man
Far as rap I don't see no competitors and
you see things like me, with my medal in hand
I'm a state case boy with a federal plan
A hundred in beats, beatin the shit out skinheads
I'm the spirit of a G bringin lyrics of the street
I'm Ca$his, a real dope boy on the beat (beat)
Slumped in the seat tucked clutchin the heat
Basically, you niggaz can't fuck with me, hah

[Chorus One: Ca$his]
We run this shit, fo'-five on the hip
Out to ride for Shady, yeah
Y'all niggaz ain't hard, y'all niggaz ain't real
Y'all niggaz ain't crazy
Bring it on if you want, you don't know
the homicides that I've done lately
We run this shit, fo'-five on the hip
Out to ride for Shady

[Obie Trice]
Yeah, Trice is back on the Alche' track
With Ca$his, capitalizin on this mic in fact
We fuckin with the captain of rap
My nigga with the Nike cap keep the continuity quite exact
So allure your cats into the second classic
We're mature as the number uno aspect, as yet
Who's to pass the driver?
O tries to flow to die fo' and the death blow survive (woo!)
I echo through your external vibe
with internal experiences I've acquired (uhh)
I'm probably the most honest hip-hopper alive
A victim depictin images from my own eyes (yeah!)
Never livin through homes, why?
Homie got his own set of cajones, stand up guy
It's Ca$his, O. Tri', rappers we blow by
This is as accurate as the masses will have it, no lie
Nigga!

[Chorus Two: Obie Trice]
We run this shit, fo'-five on the hip
Been ridin for Shady (Shady, Shady)
Y'all niggaz ain't G.O.A.T., y'all niggaz ain't skill
Y'all niggaz ain't crazy (crazy)
Bring it on if you want, you don't know
the homicides that I got lately (nigga!)
We run this shit, fo'-five on the hip
Been ridin for Shady (Shady)

Song:   We Do Appreciate It
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[The Nope]
Why you don't like us, {?}
I'm snackin on some Idahos that come from the ground
Every time I make a sound, bugs goes 'round
I hear a bunch of flowin dub and it bugs me
Don't work me in a good {?} who doesn't love me
A lot of people deep inside is just ugly
You don't know how we... we so lovely
I mean our favorite {?} wanna get cuddly
Cause we the motherfuckin N.O., don't pretend though
That you don't wanna give us props, suck my cyclops
Until it's all dry dotch
That's what you get if you got a soft set
So, remember in the future
That when The Nope come you better raise the roof up
The rap industry is a major goof up
You paid to do stuff, your haters ain't major
Every player you suck
You're just proof that you got some goop on your tooth bruh
Use a toothbrush
I surf, nigga on some Blue Crush
So once again you can suck the dick or two nuts

Yeah, be positive they say
With artists in my way, you hotter than {?} try not to think
I'm not the thinking man's rapper
I don't rap for any man, I'm the man rapper, think!
Since you got first, second and unleaded
Wouldn't go ride a rental with just letters
You can't make salad if you use just lettuce
And just cause you can go fast you're not expressive
Don't be mad at a man cause you're expressive
She had to move on he was just open and just catch it
Either that or he throwed her the bone and she just fetch it
So you can call her a bitch but you bet you just jealous
Betoch, watch, we the best fellas
We get on the stage and only just wreck it

Song:   Net Weight
Typed by: nelly@itis.com

Hook:
Net weight gotta make papes
Multiple ways to get paid these days
Net weight various ways to make figures
And when it comes to money yo Grant's my nigga     (x2)

Verse 1:
A-yo take a moment and recognize I'm not average everyday
Act to display or disguise my enterprise in a wrong way
I got the rightaway, position myself for a brighter day
It's goin' okay
Like chron mixed with Alize on Friday a highday
I got two dice a Paradise (pair of dice)  like Sade
Whenever I innovate precise words demonstrate
You're hooked like bait and bent all out of shape
To see me carry my net weight and gain adrenaline
I rock a rhyme like a timberland pole with soul
Emblem, Barber Shop is hemmin' 'em up
Subliminal stuff diamond in the rough
Mentally hand cuffed

Hook 

Verse 2:
Net weight your midstate I anticipate this year alone
To microphones and money I'm prone it's on
To do what I gotta, rent a room at the Ramada
In any state I make the rhyme rate harder to deal with
Ill shit take a whole lot energy and Henessy your remedy
Remember me, on a long term ready to skip a quick fix
And guess who's in the mix on deck with the Knicks
Sickly I approach, genuine like leather bags from coats
To raps what I wrote sit back and take notes
Get up and perform I make the mic warm
A-yo this ain't the norm
MC with procedures at my leisure 
Get the doe from the promo before he catches amnesia

Hook

"That's why we gotta make moves"

Verse 3:
Net weight gotta make papes in an orderly fashion
Blastin' give me the loot I ain't askin' a damn thing
I be pullin' women like a hamstring
You be puttin' down payments on a romance ring
Fancy things while I stare with the glare that's rare
Beware this sonny don't share his goods he shares his bads
He shares his ? and height drags while he smoke his bags
Toes get tagged, travelin' on a straight line 
People get they're ear to the grapevine
Twine twine and take mine 
But they can't get near the brand new tear for this year
And grew the trick weed plus gear
I got the antidote for sounding dope
And I hope for nothing
Learn everything to earn net weight for something

Hook

"Yo where's my weed at?"

Song:   We're Back
Typed by: britkill@tlen.pl

[Eminem]
Nothing can stop and nothing can change
And you better just make new livin' arrangments
If you think, you the top and king of the castle
You about to be thrown off the throne and ripped a new asshole
All I hear is I'm the best at this and I'm best at that
But I don't hear my name, no ?? brought up in rap
And I don't usually trip or damn get caught up in that
But when they say one of the best, I'm nowhere thought up as that
Not even the same leage as Jay-Z, Nas, Pac, Biggie or maybe
The name me somewhere down at the bottom, right after AZ
Or say he ripped that Biggie verse, or that Jay-Z
Yo his verses were crazy, on that "Renegade" beat
But I ain't never bought no whole CD of Shady
And all I hear is pop tunes come on the Radi-O
And they play 'em 20 times in a row daily
And they very well maybe
The same reason they don't say me
When they speak on hip-hop legends which is amaze me
Cause I thought the formula was to hit mainstream
And make it big ba big big bay ba baby

[Obie Trice]
So maybe the eighties made me crazy
I've been tryin to get my weight up since the ace Slim Shady
Gave me the gate key, paved the way
So lately, my stakes get better each day
Replay my relay race, when I was chasin the afee at eighteen
Eight years later his voice in Beijing
No choice I chase cream, so

[Eminem] SHAAADDYYY!!!(STAT QUO!)We're back!

[Stat Quo]
This is what I eat, sleep and breath and feed my kids
Would it fulfill all my family needs (c'mon)
I treat the mic like the block
Fuck with my rocks, and squeeze
Critics expecting me to underachieve
I just deal with the hate I recieve
By rolling back my sleeves
Sure was a breeze, I bring him right to his knees
And tell him "suck my dick"
I take a bow and leave
With a sack full of unmarked cheese
I find it hard to believe
Who to pull or proceed
To be G's and claim they runnin shit
Nigga I run me
As a kid, teacher said I had a mouth on me
The same mouth got me the deal with Dre and E
Folk in the hood be askin, where I be
Dogg, I'm out in Hawaii
Don't like it? drink my pee
Record song for the "Detox" LP
Feet don't fail he
Niggas got me bent like Cranberry and Belvee
I'ma die wealthy
Boss in the game, what the fuck they gon tell me?
A towns auntre, Aftermath, Shady!

[Eminem] SHAAADDYYY!!!(BOBBY CREEK!)We're back!

[Bobby Creekwater]
Y'all market y'all block, they sent me to corner that
Rap game's an old flame, my nigga I want 'em back
Like mic check
Pimp for what it's worth I got the right net
Sittin' here excited by some shit that aint right yet
No regret, live by a code you don't know bout
Y'all niggas won't be certified till I show I
Go out on a limb with Em cause I'm wid him
Put a barrel to the apparel of you and some of them
Stand a chance, at the dance, without a Bow tie
Shady Records re-introduce you niggas to Mow-ti
So high, of the light that they have given me
And the haters like a shofurr because it's driven me
To a view with a vendetta I am the apitomee
I don't give a fuck about ya nigga I'm just livin me
We the reason for the season so I'm breezin through the track
Nigga

[Eminem] SHAAADDYYY!!!(CA$HIS!)

[Ca$his]
I can prove I'm here to do something you never do
From hand to hand coke sales, from my revenue
I ain't been toa function, where I ain't snuck a weapon through
Cause my background reveals a one eight seven too
To the block, I'm the truth
To the cops, I'm the proof of this
And niggas still out there, you just gotta shoot
I carry over my street ethics, to the booth
And the shady crime fam, Al Capone in his youth
The difference between me and you, I already done it
And lived the street life, niggas run away from if
You follow my life, in a midwest blunted
Pitchforks held high, four fifth by the stomach
You can find me right now, on the C.A. streets
I'm on the roof, of the building, shooting at police
Some of the homies feel opposition can't kill me
I'm a walking obituary, death live in me
I take life through the pen, by the way I'ma see
Or have you raped in the pen, like American meat
I'm connected gettin weight from MS 13
With S.K's, A.R's and Mini fourteens
I'm Cashis, the last of the real, with a strap
On Pro-sac, D's and E-Pills, it's a rap
Get the block on tip, two for tens of crack
I'm in a lifetime contract, Shady's back
Nigga

[Chorus (Ras Kass)]
What do you want? - I want it all, I wanna ball
I want a million hoes to call

And 24s so clean, they blind the block (bling!)
What do you want? - Y'all to admit it I'm good

What do you want? - Paper to waist
So much paper, Bush wanna take it away

[Scipio]
Yeah, it might sound selfish, but I want a lot
Everything possibly attainable on a block
One shot rifle, revolver glocks
I'm greedy, gimme what chu got or get shot
I, need about a million dollars to chill
And get ride of these clowns and showcase the real
Show these hoe casing folk'll lace ya grill
Fold ya face, playing in a baking field
I will smash any rapper that talk shit
Clap and leave a cavity the size of my fist
I am no bitch, I'ma let it be known
When I let the baretta go, niggaz betta hit the flo' (ah!)
Get the chedda and go, I repo green
Flame spitter, with a deep ol' lean
Got bitches like - "He's so clean!"
Young Scipio ill, plus got a leth-al team
So tell me

[Chorus (Ras Kass)]
What do you want? - I want it all, I wanna ball
I want a million hoes to call (C'mon!)

[Scipio]
What do you want? - A different chick for every day of the week
They steady bringing me cheese
What do you want? - The same bitches to know
I don't play, I need my dough (hoe!)
What do you want? - My vehicle's thorn
I want Lil Kim to stop rapping and do porn
What do you want? - To spit forever
I'm immortal with the flow when putting this shit together
What do you want? - Nine hundred thou' up front
I want these record labels to know I ain't no punk
I'll tell ya what I want, stop re-making Pac hits
Cos when y'all was beefing, you was quiet as shit (bitch!)
What do you want? - Ya don't really wanna know
Go toe to toe with a pro, that's colder than snow
Colder than the toe of the hoe that's working the track
Y'all niggaz don't want it with that, I'll tell ya

[Chorus (Ras Kass)]
What do you want? - I want it all, I wanna ball
I want a million hoes to call (C'mon!)
What do you want? - A nine to pop

I don't talk it, I live it, I'm hood (Forget it!)
What do you want? - Paper to waist
So much paper, Bush wanna take it away

[Scipio]
I want a house by the lake, my account fulla cakes
Super models that'll kid, be my spouse for the day
Out to get paid, I got a motivated click
Scipio's will let 'em crack the game and get rich
It's about time I get some shit that I want
Like a chick that won't front, and gimme face 'til I'm done
Chill in the slums, post 'til a nigga touch down
And still ride with me doing 80 off Crown (What do you want?)
Gimme a G-S, X-L-P-D-X
On Check Bailey's, and heat with a feet rest
I got homie's that'll pop off a clip
And run up in ya property cos you're proabably a snitch
I want outer towners, to stop rocking our fits
Khakis and chucks like you started this shit
I want y'all to admit that dude is nice
Don't get it mis-con-screwed, I'll do ya wife

[Chorus (Ras Kass)]
What do you want? - I want it all, I wanna ball (yeah, yeah!)
I want a million hoes to call (C'mon!)
What do you want? - A nine to pop
And 24s so clean, they blind the block (Scipio!)
What do you want? - Y'all to admit it I'm good
I don't talk it, I live it, I'm hood (Forget it!)
What do you want? - Paper to waist
So much paper, Bush wanna take it away (Uh huh)
What do you want?

[Ras Kass]
A hun'ed mill, five mic, a five riker ak-rite

Verse 1 *(San Quinn)*

It's lethal
the streets'll take ya where ya don't need to go

conflict of intrest
because my Mobb is relentless
suckas don't wanna see us in this or win this

not concerned about the murder rate so when I'm a get drilled
I be prayed up

wakin up's enough for me
but when I rhyme my minds on the grind
strictly hustlin
I'm back to bust

*(Chorus)* 2x

Verse 2 *(Messy Marv)*

Bow down to the west world

kept it up in the case

we rappers say "This is fake" when people's quick to bomb on ya
an bet a dime on ya
befo' ya make a false move
then get lost in yo crew
now they all boo-hoo
ya stay in doo-doo
fucked around an got flushed

blow bomb-diggy on my way back to the big city.

*(Chorus)* 2x

Verse 3 *(San Quinn)*

Respect

[Girl]	Oh...Tell me more

	Whatever you want, it's yours
	And if I ain't got it, I'll get more
	Whether inside or in stores
	I wanna be what you're looking for

	Whatever you want it's yours
	And if I ain't got it, I'll get more
	Whether inside or in stores
	I wanna be what you're looking for

So you say you want a resume, references
Contacts on relationships
How many kids is it
Where do I work, what do I do
What makes me deserve a woman like you
I work hard, play hard
Lace soft but stay hard
I'll sacrifice to please you
Mami, I'm tryin' to see you

Repeat 1

Now, I'm a damn good man with some damn good love
Trying to find someone to give it to, yeah
(Oh yeah?)
And I'm down to lace it on you
Give me the time and the place
Just show you face
Show me the line in the race
I'll be your ace
I just wanna love you 
Give me the chance to show you, I want you

Repeat 1

[Curtis Conway] - rap
So listen here love, you get what you ask for
Material things are smaller'n me cuz I offer more
And won't y'all fool the teacher when I say this
Willing to do what it takes honey 
Just to get in the mix with you
So listen, boo, picture me and you
Candlelight dinner for two, romantic rondevous 
You only live once, don't miss a chance of a lifetime
You want the world and I'll give it
Because it's all mine

Song:   What Is Love
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I would tell you that I love you tonight
But I know that I've got time on my side
Where you goin'? Why you leavin' so soon?
Is there somewhere else that's better for you?

What is love if you're not here with me?
What is love if it's not guaranteed?
What is love if it just ups and leaves?

What is love if you're not here no more?
What is love if you're not really sure?
What is love?
What is love?

Tell myself I wouldn't cry when you're gone
But I know it's easier said than done
Look at me, look at me, choked up now
Try to tell you but it won't come out

What is love if you're not here with me?
What is love if it's not guaranteed?
What is love if it just ups and leaves?

What is love if you're not here no more?
What is love if you're not really sure?
What is love if it just ups and goes?

I can't live without you (I can't live without you)
I can't live with you (I can't live with you)
What goes around will come right back around, you won't know 'til it hit you
We were supposed to be (an empire)
We were supposed to be (an empire)
We were supposed to be an empire

What is love if you're not here with me?
What is love if it's not guaranteed?
What is love if it just ups and leaves?

What is love?
What is love if you're not really sure?
What is love if it just ups?

Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Ice Cube]
So yo check this out
This is Ice Cube from the Westside Connection
Callin all the way from Johannesburg, South Africa
The world has never seen a million black men in one place
But on October 16, in Washington, D.C., a million black men will gather

"This is a mission, not a small time thing" (sample repeats)

[Mobb Deep]
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, word up son, check it out though
YaknowhatI'msayin?  Word up son
Listen up son, knowhatI'msayin?
(Watch out for them man) Listen up son, check it out though, yo

Open your eyes get wise and look alive focus your attention
Windows 95 updated high tech lynchin
Crosses of the colored man who claims he holds the keys to the safe
Secrets of the world, blow him in his face
Who's the master of the universe, galaxy and planets
Babylonians ecstatic moon the sinkin of Atlantis
(Be the one soul original black filled with melanin
 Goin out like represent Kuwait in two thousand)

[Ice-T]
Brothers gonna have to put themself in check
Three strikes you in the penzo, checked to your neck
Your woman cries, your baby grows up alone
Talkin through a three inch glass on a two way phone
You tell me brothers got no options today
You best to listen to the Ice closely fool, crime don't pay
Gas and dope bullets and coke ain't the way
You need to march with the Nation on Atonement Day, represent

[Chuck D]
Now, to all my brothers we be rhymin like this
Yeah I can handle, but they can't kill it mill or dismantle it
And we can leave the component alone
Show all my brothers a brother instead of negro
Crackers in the back obscene knahmean
But I've been knockin em out the box like ??
So on the single we be flowin at the lingo
Comin together, not solo like Mandingo

Chorus: all together

So where you at y'all?
        Right here, hangin with my brothers and we showin no fear
So where you at y'all?
        Right here, if you represent then throw your hands in the air

[Smooth B]
Arm Leg Leg Arm Head
My people with braids waves dreads and baldheads
A million strong doin duty, wisdom strength beauty
Ummah Ahs they are, sun moon star
And it's a holy day, come sober
Smooth B in D.C., sixteenth of October
In unity there is power, none can devour
Hour after hour, we shower

[RZA & Killah Priest]
Imagine us travellin back to Nazareth
        Most fabulous
To raise up the black dead slaves like Lazarus
        When I catch rays through the blaze holy essays
        No more death days and vexed slaves possessed in caves
Yo it's the last days and times we gots to raise your mind
Brothers walk around dumb different and blind
Pregnant Earths always carry eggs
I pledge to never fall off the ledge
and blacks remain family like Sister Sledge

[Shorty]
God prepared the table for us, in the presence of our enemy
Now we soon to be, one in unity
One two three I'm a G
But the God inside is that G I chose to be
The world is a stage and everybody plays a part
I'm not considered, the one with a sensitive heart
When I say black man you say go
Black man GO black man GO

Chorus

[DA Smart]
Somebody stole me, you took me from Kunta to Toby
and mold me, in a way that you freed me but still hold me
What you tryin to pull?  Eatin us like cannibals
Whatever happened to that forty acres and that animal
Now you tryin to use integration just to fool us
Like Malcolm said, we been hoodwinked and bamboozled
Mama cryin, and I ain't lyin
I'm going to Washington for justice, I'ma get it, or die tryin
Don't hesitate, he's at the gate
And that's a million black men in one place to set it straight
So black women applaud the black God
I'm DA Smart, with the million man march

[KAM]
Damn that's how you know the world about to end
Rain hail snow earthquakes and a million black men
Upon the God indivisible
With liberty and justice for all cause y'all done made us miserable
With this AmeriKKKan nightmare
That's why October 16th we gon be right there like yeah
The same niggaz that you want gone
Well we about a million deep on your front lawn
It's goin on from here to Abraham Lincoln's statue
And every brother here thinkin yeah we need to holla at you
About this overdue bidness
With the Black Muslim, Christian Jew and Jehovah Witness
To get this out in the open the only way
Is for us to declare a black holy day
The homies say that they rollin
Plus we got family, forty miles up, controllin

Blacking on every song

[Merchant]
Never too complex to where it fly
over the heads of 85, I strive
to stay real and keep hip-hop alive
Revive thoughts collide, you better slide I advise
You keep the eyes on the prize, my metal rips
Militant minded like the prejudice devils I shatter
This march was meant to spark a million diligent hearts
or e'rylife, we even see alike so play your part

[Lord Jamal]
Knowledge equality, born gods can follow me
as we swarm the yard like bees out in D.C.
The TV'll televise the revolution for sellin lies
within the constitution, realise the former solution
October 16th, a million black minds comin intertwined on the fact find
Lord Jamal, black Jesus and I stack rhymes
but the black-on-black crime that attack mine

Chorus: all together

So where you at y'all?
           Right here, hangin with my brothers and we showin no fear
So where you at y'all?

[ERule]
Hear my synopsis, I drop this
Generates thoughts of born-awareness of the here-and-now
Buildin a poem with many spearin out
Society inflaws unjust laws remain the voided common cause
Equality rules you to love that equality
Many's law to trust this
Act of the devil possess the sword of justice
Take the devil's head thru levels nad bad truth can spread to mental dead

Imagine us travellin back to Nazareth

Brothers walk around dumb different and blind
Pregnant Earths always carry eggs

[Sunz Of Man]
As we struggle in the jungle of sin, my thoughts are militant
destroyin the ignorance, buildin the innocent
Teachin infants infinite knowledge
that wasn't taught in high schools or college
My representation is with the 30 million man destination
Washington, D.C., war with the masons
The only celebration is Satan's elimination
The past education at the present is relevations
The future's our creation, elevation of the nation

Chorus

[Brooklyn Zoo]
Yo around Red (16) October
BROOKLYN ZOO attack like cobra
Killin warrior soldiers in D.C., you face Jehovah all over
the darkside, I ride tracks to provide
elementive intelligence while you fake MC's hide
LEFT RIGHT as I command all my sons cos I'm grand
(Pull his head, snatch land) See if I slide thru the sand
Snakin those who choose to fake moves on Zoo, ya get bruised
(Bring ya crew) Opposin the chosen son of God, you get scarred hard

[Chuck D]
Now, to all my brothers we be rhymin like this
Yeah I can handle, but they can't kill it mill or dismantle it
And we can leave the component alone
Show all my brothers a brother instead of negro

Intro: 
The C.O.L.O.N.Y. east coast and the west coast fuse together this shit
ain't dope it's a musical treasure never come and test a, dope MC like
Brown and the C.O. check this. Lil El.

Brown:
Crusin' down the street in my 64 
A brother stuck a strap in my window
So I grabbed the strap mashed on the gas
Had that brother running down the block like the Flash
Shouldn't of tried to stick Brown for his cash
Doing 65 on the shore that's his ass
I let him go the nigga screamed "No"
He had a little heart though and bucked at my door 
As he rolled and rolled, I seen it all in my mirror of my 64
I even got proof buckshots in my door 
Where ever you go keep one eye open at all times
Cause you can get got or even get popped
From hood to hood it ain't all good
You better watch you back, where ever you at

Hook:
On the east we got the guns, (on the west we got gats)
On the east we lick a shot, (on the west we peel your cap)
Only two bags of buddah, (to chronic sacks) 
Cause it ain't where you from it's where you at

C.O.:
Rollin' dice with plum gettin' high in the park
Strapped with ooh ops cause it's crazy after dark
Cause when shit gets sparked niggas feel the heat
From the city that never sleeps or skips a beat
On the streets your incomplete if your not ready for whatever
Cause niggas in the streets be ill and steady 
24-7 fuckin' days a week
Lights and great heights right in the concrete
Day time night time brawls in the heat
These are the things that happen in the street don't sleep
Murder rate crime constantly all the time
For every nigga gets ahead there's another one behind
Trying to get hip to the strive to get mine
Cause life's like a mountain an endless climb for this rhyme thing
Hood to hood shit's no good guard your grill killer

Hook

Lil El:
Nine to five hit me one time because I'm so damn high
I get kodiac lord of the chronic sack
Plus I've been a phat mack ever since wayback
When it was 2 point 0 for the dove sack
Give me a phat track I'll give you phat raps
My verbal haze took over the west coast 
It's no secret who's herb you love the most
And now we be chillin' with the east coast villians
Exchanging methods on the way we gonna kill 'em
You get the guns and we'll get your back 
And you can bust shots and we'll peel the cap
From hood to hood it aint all good you better watch you back nigga

Hook

Keep your head up Queens for the funds 
Coming no triple beam dream and them fiends ain't on my team
Got my strippin' for the cream so I lean
Gun free get the scene on the ski mask 
And action set set ready for blastin'
Stickinn' your crew in disorderly fashion 
Rashin' mean never son you're fuckin' with a clever one
Foe fiends listen more power then Tom Eddison
On the doo op I light the crowd like an ooh op
No witness to the rhyme vandel evidence is surcumstancial
And I still I grip a pistol by the handle
then start blowin' out niggas like 16 candles
He cold I smoke the fuckin' blunts to the roach
And we're quick to break y'all niggas if ya fell in your approach
Cause the gang bangers drug hangers and gun slangers
Just keep gettin' the money it's all good honey yeah yeah yeah

See sorry baby but I gotta do what I gotta
It ain't where you from it's where ya at      (x4)

East coast, west coast (x4)

[Mr. Shadow]
E-Dubb
We gon' talk it like this

(Verse 1)
Who drops that gangsta shit
And don't quit
Who's that bald motherfucker that be (???) your bitch (Who?)
I'm a sick motherfucker til the day that I'm gone
Me and my shadow on the balcony, hittin' the bong (Yeah)
Only the strong survives on these streets
Of Southern California, better know where this lead
We still bangin'
Aiming at your frame, cause you claiming
I just runnin' everythang, in this game that we playin'
You're weak
What you make in a year, I make in a week
I roll with motherfuckers that'll put you to sleep
Forever
In any weather, don't matter the time
You won't find another clique that is sicker than mine
This is westside, enemies hide and live in shelter
Lookin' like a mug with heat rocks that'll melt ya
I'm a let the world hear the unheard
And see the unseen, I am the latest word
Biotch

Chorus: Mr. Shadow
Who drops them gangsta hits and don't quit (Quit)
Who makes them haters split with real shit (Shit)
Who keeps the doobie lit with convicts
And gets, into shit, with glass metals or sticks (Who?)

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 2)
When I slide on your side (What's up)
You all hide
Cause you know it's my show, put your ass on quiet time
A violent crime on this side of the line
One time, have a fit, when they see me in mine
Don't waste my time, cause it can get real nasty
That's to all you Marx
Claimin' you're gonna blast me
Pass me a bottle and a chronic sack
Where's all my motherfuckin' gangsters and my bitches at
The shit is phat
It's on like that
Little homies stay
Pimpin', big time and broke bitches don't know me
Show me what I came for, dollar bills with big faces
Big exchanges in abandonded places
Ransom cases
To the average fool don't know
The type of shit that makes a thug violate his parole
You best leave it alone
In the west, it's no lie
Still down to die for anything in my life
You motherfuckers

Repeat Chorus Twice

[Mr. Shadow {*E-Dubb scratching in background*}]
I'm a light this rocket
Yeah, so you stealing motherfuckers
Ask yourself who
Look behind you, bitch
Gon' be
Gonna ask you

(Verse 3)
It ain't nothin' to a boss (Hell nah)
You get tossed
Whenever you come across a bigger set of balls
Don't trigger me off, I ain't nothing to fuck with
And when I come through, buckin' ass, you better duck quick
Fuck this
It's a man's world and you're bitches
Dime dropping snitches
Your life is finished
Hun
I'm a menace
All about business
Stay out of mine or get served with stiffness
My shit list can go on for days
But there's too many motherfuckers to be mentioning names
Fuck 'em all (Fuck 'em all)
Took 'em all deep in soil
Much love to all my peeps stayin' true and loyal
We live the life of a thug cause that's all we know
In the streets, bringin' heat, staying G for sho
SoCal in your mouth, westside of the states
Step aside or get walked on
In CA, yeah

[Pimpstress]
Cuz I'm the, Pimpstress, the baddest bitch
Clothes always baggy for the stitch and the itch
Thirty-five oh no, steady hittin' licks
Dreams to be rich, and be on top of the list
Brown eyes and bow legs, steady turnin' heads
Fuck all the cappin' cuz yo I'm all about my bread
Corsege lens, put that down on the Benz
Rags to riches and get more grip from my pen
S.P.M. Put it down, and left it to me
I got that chrome M.V.P., hustlin' loyal dope fiends
Rollin' deep, gettin' crunk, smokin' blunts with codeine
Sacked the cream, triple beam, platinum records just gleam
Poppas, don't wet on your own carpets
Hollow tips, I'm on that, puttin' snitches in check
Drop gold diggers, floss chrome triggers
Dopehouse my crew, at six figures

Chorus:

Who am I? Pimpstress for life
Dopehouse is the family, so I gotta stay tight
Wreckin' shows in girbauds, slammin' through the side doors
I'm the coldest Latina, in them baggy ass clothes
Squeeze lip, pop trunk and recline
Woodstrip, candy paint, I owe it all to my rhyme
I'm the coldest female rapper in this industry
From A-Town to H-Town I put it down for the three

[Pimpstress]
The dopest bitch in the clique, snappin' them necks
Cashin' them checks, what it takes to get wet
That's on the real baby, sometimes hoe be actin' shady
Disrespectin' a pimp, get a chip, from my three eighty
They want beef pimp, then voy a lo piscina
Big tits I'll flip, I got'cha chocolate Latina
Creamy thighs so lovely, ballas wanna touch me
Maybe cuz I'm down to pimp, they wanna fuck me
Ice on my rings, S.P.M. it's a shame
So many killas on my team, you'd think we're a gang
From Austin to Cali, New York to the valley
Babies screamin' for the pimp because they know this bitch is bout it
Mob affiliated, to run with my killas, drug dealers
Those muthafuckas who be down for the scrilla
Pimpstress is what they call me, female roll call
Knockin' pictures off the wall, Dopehouse is standin' tall

Chorus

[Pimpstress]
Last but not least, I'm the freestylin' beast
My pimp goes on sheets, I pimp my pen like most freaks
All them G's that be saggin', this a high dive act
Went out with the pimp, I got you comin' so fast
Crystal barros, and bezzle champagne
S.P.M. put it down, check the emblem on my chain
Kiss the pinky ring, get up off your knees
Dopehouse is family, Austin, Texas where I be
Southwest from the 3, I kick it down from where I see
Then you G's you got beef, que pasa?
Bounce is dead, and let it be known
On this microphone, I stand alone
Automatic chrome, underneath my throne
Don't make me reach for my heat, or bad heat will meet you home
Miss Pimpstress, dismiss your existence
Have you callin' me from Hell, long distance

[sample]
Just me and you girl, whoa
Just me and you girl, whoa

[Kanye West]
Trynna sneak upstairs, to your apartment, aren't you a sight for red eyes?
I just flew and slipped in on your left side
Dressed in satin gown, you asleep with no makeup
I'm just trynna be inside you before you wake up (Just me and you girl, whoa)
We had problems, but that's all in the past
Everybody got problems, baby, I did that past
Remember I used to do things that'll make you laugh?
Like ordering a girl drink in a matching glass
She liked pina coladas getting caught in the rain
Or rocking flannels all summer like Kurt Cobain
Or that Dolce Gabana with a few gold chains
And you the type of girl, that probably deserve a new last name
But, they never let us do our thing
Everybody lying, on who I bang
We was on fire, but they blew our flame
Ain't no denying, baby, you have changed
Cuz now your high heels clicking, your lip gloss glisten
Your hips starts switching, you pissed off tripping
Cuz even when we kissing, baby girl, feel different
Friends all diss 'em, like, no he didn't
No he didn't, is you talking about Kitten?
Is that bitch still stripping trynna get a pair of Christians?
I swear to God that they got you going crazy
But you play it off and say "How's work baby?"
Well, some of the models is coked up to walk straight
But seem to still love the man that they all hate
But babe I'll call you back you say you say that always
And kept me on the phone and demand that they all wait
See, she knew about all my lies, the whole time
And my credit so bad, I can't get no one to co-sign
I would of thought she would of bust through the door crying
But she up and left a nigga and she ain't give me no sign, now
She back in the club in a tight dress
With some dreams of some day wearing a white dress
Seen with some lame, it's a miracle, that
She would talk to a nigga with a ten year ago swag
Plus I don't like none of her girlfriends
Quote on quote, cuz her girlfriends got girlfriends
On the phone, hollerin' at niggas is whatever
Let's fly to Euro, make this the best summer ever
Now she headed to Rome, Rome is the home
Rome is where she act like she ain't got no fucking phone
I accept that I was wrong, accept a nigga grown
So I can't bitch and moan in a session getting stoned
So a nigga had to hop on a plane, a bus and a train
To try to come and talk and explain
Rented the whole bottom floor for a candlelight dinner
Turn the lights out and put my candle right in her
And told her even though I met you in a club in a tight dress
At first sight, I could picture you in a white dress
Thirty foot train, diamond from Loraine
Just to makeup for all the years and the pain
Family on both sides, I'm so glad you came
Auntie couldn't make, oh no, that's a shame
Wedding in June, what could be better?
Let's fly to Euro, make this the best summer
Took the very last car of the Euro style
Tell the conductor, just drive so far
Told some of your friends and they wasn't excited
But we could tour the country side and they won't be invited
We would not be disturbed by the fussing and fighting
Tell Peaches light the Herb cuz we just reunited
Let's make a move from these herbs, go somewhere private
I'm talking just me and you, and a plane and a pilot, uh

(Verse I)
Yo, we the killer kids
And everything we spit be the most extradinary
Tremendous, rap come in flurries
Outbreaks of violence enhance the bars
We all generals and claim status, we five stars
Been goin' hard since the growth in the womb
Album comin' soon we gon' show niggas the tombs
That we call apartments, use you consciencness
Q.B. the graveyard we the harvesters, to this
( ? ) and raw lyrics
Create a mosh pit and thug niggas and ban all beginners
Crud be the cry for my niggas in arms
Military style, is little dolls runnin' wild
World full or war lords and barbarians
We at the top of the list so who you better than?
High-voletules street full of ( ? )
Back down bitches with brain, the crud logical

(Chorus)
Aiyo, why y'all wanna play with my team
Why y'all think everything just a motherfuckin' game
For the haters I advise you to zip your lip
Or you might get hit with some shit thats spit is kildren
Why y'all want to play with my team
Why y'all think everything is just a motherfuckin' game
It's Q.B. crud love; who want what
Act up for real spit slap mouth out ya grill

(Verse II)
Aiyo why you watchin' me close for
You don't know that I'll blow four
Leave you in a casket with a closed door
Jealousy; why, 'cause you ain't likin' a kid?
Soon my wrist be lit, like the lights on a bridge
You in trainin' now, what'chu fightin' your bitch
You can act real good who writin the script
It ain't no problem when gettin' low
And the only milk that I ever spilled is when I missed the 'bow
So don't re-talk it nigga like it's war when you see me
Crudded out, all tall when you see me
You doin' your bird, tryna skip the line
I hope she don't wait a whole year
'Cause she tellin' me the kid is mine
Aiyo my life ain't shit of course
And I'm depressed, with gray hair face down to my chest
Let's get it poppin' you plottin
Nigga it won't work
It'll only get you stomped out till it don't hurt

(Chorus)

(Verse III)
Yo, the '86 throw back
Muna better than ever
To equalize under the level, who want it?
Shit bow niggas get flushed down the toilet
For them slick talkin' niggas that order it
Parties - we spoil it
Have promoters closin' the clubs
Blowin' on dubs quick to disperse let out a slugs
Muena from the heaven above
Crud love, add on, and get your math right
Rhyme flow tight some laminate thugs
Lose eyesight triple-O sanikes
Have you weaken at the beekend
Heat seakin' scope you out
Kildren the nicest; street word of mouth
Curbing you out on the four front 
of the orange lure import new ports and we scowin' 'em out

Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

And that's my word... that's my word

Chorus:

If you're blind to the wicked ways
The devil plays mad tricks on your mind (check it out)
If you're blind of the wicked ways (yeah, check it out)
The devil plays mad tricks on your mind (yo)

Verse One: Killah Priest

The President just ordered the Navy to hit the borders of Haiti
Slaughter babies from the waters of Euphrates
Maybe they sent germ that's polluted our sperm
And made us live uncircumcised in the serpent eyes
And told us certain lies, and each day a servant dies
But in the halls of Pharoah the walls are narrow
And religion is like a prison for the seekers of wisdom
This be the dance of the graveyard
So do the spank with the dead zombie
Here comes the tanks of a Red Army
The real Jew is you, Jeremiah fourteen and two
Enforced by the Hebrew
Ya hovered by the eagle, America is evil
Let no man deceive you, beat you, or mistreat you
The tribe of Edem, stole your freedom
And Edem means redneck
I'm throwin bullets in my Tec
Nah, I'm goin out like Joshua
With a pen, an army, and an apocalypse

Chorus:

If you're blind to the wicked ways
The devil plays mad tricks on your mind
If you're blind to the wicked ways
The devil plays mad tricks on your mind

Verse Two: Hell Razah

I remember
The six doctors, that wanted to take my brain into a labratory
Destroy me, since birth
My baby talk was psychic thoughts
Flashbacks, all the past blacks trapped in the present
Killin for dead presidents, where every ghetto residence
is evidence, and the future, there will never be none
If we don't be-come, unity
Or get them devil made guns, and leave them demons bleedings
Give em BACK with tons of speeding bullets
Fuck your tech-nology, it's trick-knowledgy
Tellin lies to my vision, I was given, enough time
To master, the criminology
And Mr. Pastor, teachin demonology
Words of dope knowledge, I demolish
Evil men, with an easy win
When my thoughts are spaced out, come down to EARTH
The devil crawls, cuz he's only, jealous
And a victim of the unholy ghost

Chorus:

If you're blind to the wicked ways
The devil plays mad tricks on your mind (mind)
If you're blind to the wicked ways
The devil plays mad tricks on your mind

Verse Three: 7th Ambassador

He listens to the cries in the distance
of the next victim, wishin, that he had some assistance
And right before his eyes it appeared
Beware when the shadow caster, demon master's in the near
He blocked the true light from your sight
And transformed your brightest days, into your darkest nights
I had your blind man praisin the grave
Cause he feel the cross, that lays in the dirt
And think he's in the church, not even aware
That death is near, and he's one step from his grave
A naive mental slave if he had, his third eye sparked
He mighta been scopin
Them demons that be lurkin in the dark
Always keep your glowin eye open
By knowin who your enemies be
I can see you but you can't see me
Escape from your chains like, Great Houdini
And dissapear, like a majestic genie, in midair
Vanish, that's my advantage
And then I transform to a hurricane storm
And rain holy water, for seven days
And seven nights, the chosen ones spark the light
Of the Sun, that's killin off villains by the ton
Sealin all the doors to the Hells, correct spells
That were cast on my peeps that were weak
Made to keep, my peeps in a deep sleep

Verse Four: 60 Sec. Assassin

Behold!  The angels out the heaven
Who professes a whole new rap, session reposessin the gossip
back so black, better hand over your act, or trapped, to
Seven fifty three, who have received the law
By the dispositions of angels, and have not, kept it
Transgressed it, better burn your testaments
Ain't nothing changed niggaz is gettin arrested
Beat down like wrestling
On the count, of false impression, indiscretion
Advise em all with the glimpse, of a third eye
The silent sleep, and wicked
I work you niggaz out like physics, I blast out from the heart
of Brooklyn, like an arrow, just stick to my point
It's narrow, I shoot niggaz back, into the time
like Pharoah, I smoke up on your brain, leave it
burnt as Sahara, that leaves desert, with a rock storm
Leavin niggaz buried and puttin them at Lou's lawn
Headquarters, of the Zoo, what part, wasn't reviewed
Or didn't you understand
I'm drillin niggaz back under the surface of the land

Outro: Killah Priest

Show the righteous man, stand in great lonliness
Before the face, of such that have afflicted him
And may no account of his labels
For they see it, they shall be troubled with terrible fear
And shall, be amazed at the strangeness of his salvation
So far beyond all they were lookin for

Typed by: polish_baller@hotmail.com

Man... I'm so tired of my life right now
Got stacks and stacks of bills...
Got bill collectors calling me, harassing me everyday...
They even call me by my nickname now
People ask me what's wrong
I just tell them I got the Williams
Y'all feel me

[Chorus] 2X
I wish that I could have a second chance
Take it all away and just call it a day
But I got bills, problems, all in my way
What more can I say?
I got the Williams

All my life they told me, "save your money for a rainy day"
But I always end up buying things that take the pain away
From the bills that I can't afford
permanent credit reports
the rent that I turned in
landlord said it was short
I'm staring at a stack of past due bills
Wishin I could repossess my own dreams
Every time the phone rings
Bills collectors calling and constantly coming after you
I changed my voice so many times, they think I'm Supernatural
I said I pay you next week
Talk about it when we next speak
The way you bill collectors call it's difficult to get sleep
You on the phone begging me for money like you desperate
All you do is look at papers you sit at the fuckin desk with
I owe you for the bank loan
I'm sorry if I spent it black
if you don't want this fifty bucks I'll mail it till you send it back
temptation really got the best of me for once
now my car payments backed up at least three months
Damn

[Chorus] 2X

I wish I never had to see another day job, or punch another clock
Or beg the boss so I can go to lunch at twelve o'clock
I've been slaving overtime here a hell of a whole lot
Man, this ain't me, that's what I keep telling my own pops
I been working at the same place
movin at the same pace
dealin with these rednecks, I gotta keep a same face
game face on, I need to get a raise to get paid
Instead my supervisor warning me about my sick days
I need some credit for the days that I work
I've walked around this hellhole with my name on my shirt
Dusty and dirty everyday, I need to lease my respect
Cause child support's already reaching for a piece of my check
You think it's funny, but I'm serious
There's things we need to talk about
If I don't get my raise soon, I swear to God I'm walking out
Cause y'all awfully late, I tell you what man
I'm clocking out and goin home, soon as I come home for break

[Chorus] 4X

Yo, I'm tired of changing my voice on the phone man
These bill collectors really breaking a nigga down right now
Hell, my bills so old... I'm starting to call him William now
Oh y'all don't laugh, cuz some of y'all got the Williams too
I know, it's a shame right?
I got the Williams
Just quit my job man
Ayo Nicolay, we gon need a platinum plaque for this one
I pay for these bills, pay for this studio time
Hell, pay for these beats man
Yea, I got the Williams...

(Yeah you know whats up)
(Hey yo Litefoot show them the reel fool)

[Litefoot]
Last night I herd the cops say freeze 
But now a days life on the resay, horses and teepees 
I Never had a good day, its bad enough they took our land, 
now we dealing with this B.I.A. 
But that's an Indians life out in OK, 
I'm sendin' the smoke signals all the way to L.A. 
Put out the peace pipe, put on the war paint 
Put down the bow and arrow now I got an AK 
And then Kid Frost stepped on the plain, 
this Mexican from LA is a little insane (loco) 
Frost My people got a problem, (what's that) 
You see they keeping us down, now do you think that we can solve that?  
(Strong arm straight up, that's the solution, 
 get your self an army and start a revolution)
Pollution, in the sky, makes me cry 
I'm proud to be a Cherokee and willing to die

[Chorus: Frost]
O.G.'s fighting to survive
they bout to recognize that I'm willing to die 
O.G.'s fighting to survive 
they bout to recognize the tribe's willing to die 
(What's up dog)
(You can't hang with this can you?)
(Nah it's too real)

[Litefoot]
Fighting is in my blood, that's just the way that I am 
I'm creeping with the Prophet and my Man Cheyenne 
Circling the reservation like a vulture 
And granddaddy always kept me up on my culture (that's right) 
So I'm proud to be a Cherokee 
And the United States government ain't scaring me 
Back in the days they killed Indians for salaries 
I'm could one time modern day Calvary 
What's gonna happen when we fight back?  
Strap the guns again man they ain't gonna like that 
They gonna have to come and get me 
Black boots and hundreds of troops like 1860 
So listen to the words that I'm writing
If I'm going down, bet your ass I was fighting 
Ask me what I am and I can never deny 
I'm a Indian homeboy and I'm willing to die

Frost Chorus: 1X

(Yeah)
(Are you willing to die?)
(Yeah)
(Are you willing to die?)

[Litefoot]
We the only people in the world without a motherland 
Legally that is but I'll explain it on another chance 
I been American before there was Americans (Americans) 
Back when they to call my people redskins (redskins) 
Have you ever herd of Billy Jack 
Well this is Litefoot Homeboy and I'm a little worst than that
I come equipped with a 30 shot clip
And my tribe got the vibe so they ready to trip 
Somebody gotta take a stance so I'm ah stand up 
Talk about the problem and I'm ah bring the land up 
You took this country and you demented it 
You saw a land that was green and you cemented it 
Machinery replaced all the greenery 
And now you acting like you shouldn't mean a thing to me 
So I'm ah organize and give it one more try 
You see I'm Cherokee and willing to die

Frost Chorus: 1X

(This goes out to every Cheyenne and Apache, 
 Cherokee, Inca, the Maya, Camanche, Navajo, Aztec 
 the people of the sun, run Indian run.)

Yo man, don't even worry about that hold up I'll be with you in a second

I'm just gonna, uhhm, take these shrooms real quick

[Camu Tao]
Yo, yo, ayyo
And I see my niggaz out hollarin "Where them girls at!"
They started picturing dollars and get them girls back
Yo, where did they go?

[El-P]
To the VMA show
On the telly-o
Pirates of the circus city metal show
At every flow
To work absurd word nervous
Stumbling pissy shitty liquor's in me dizzy very slow
Bumpin in Cali-o

[Camu Tao]
Oh no
Spit on her back and have Scrams stumble in and spill a drink on her lap
I'm on the main floor with Pink smacking that ass (ahh!)
While Moby's in the rear givin P-Diddy a lap dance
Welcome to the scam order my dudes up
We +fuckin up cherub+ and piss on seats to his tour bus!

[El-P]
C'mon dawg, runnin amock will waste my lazerface
Before the mushrooms take I'm tryna hear the sound my taser makes
Hop off the bus rubber ducky tape clutch
feelin touched
waiting for the signal from Cage to rush... more

[Camu Tao]
We can't rely on that though we smokin dust moves

[El-P]
Please I got the schematics of the building on brain
Bought 'em off disgruntled janitors lookin to make a change
So fame turns to flames tonight... YAYY!

[Camu Tao]
Yo, trying to fuck up the bars Smokin cigars And breaking glasses
These stars thinkin ghetto and starts to change his accent
Yo, yo dawg, kid rock thinks he's classic
He's plastic got a two-way for Vast to kick his ass kid

[El-P]
Vordul Megala's actin regular
Trying to distract rapper's in back
While we're slip it is a rabid pack of predators
We won't be credited
Most of the greatest revolutionaries of our day and age are labeled
terrorists!

And tell her that she turned in buckets of piss
To put it in the chain stores and you'll claim it's a hit

[El-P]
OOOOO!  DAWG! I think these shrooms just hit
I had schematics memorized but all I'm think about's tits
And for any sick witted, see if you can murk with her kid
And I will place it in a stroller get some milk on my lips

[Camu Tao]
C'mon man, yo stick with the plan
When Guiliani steps on the stage +well call up your canon+
When Sherryl Crow starts her squackin we'll beat up her hands
They're trying to brainwash us with keys and video cams

[El-P]
Guiliani? Well that's Moussilini believe me moo

That ho's fourty six singing about she's soakin and shit

Artist: Phelon
Album:  The Next Chapter Compilation
Song:   Word to God
Typed by: nelly@itis.com

Intro:
Yo, and peace be with you you know what I'm sayin'?
It's the Phelon talkin' to all those between the bible and the guns.
I ain't one to judge you know what I'm sayin'?
I just call it like I see it.
And this is the way I be seeing it where I'm living.

Verse 1:
Now I was born a convict so I had to learn quick
You fight for your shit or you live like the vic
I'm locked in a cell with the bars unseen 
With the true and living God understand what I mean?
Love don't love nobody but I got love for mine so I go the whole 9
The mind is a terrible thing to waste 
Don't give a fuck about life because I never had a taste
Sunshine sometimes flowers never bloom
Play with my pistol as I sit in my room
Love to my moms and my pops 
Anything in my way then I cock and it drops

Hook:
Word to God, word to God, word to God 
Pray for your soul and that's word to God    (x4)

Verse 2:
Rocks bring cops niggas glocks bust shots 
And from Watts to new lots knots are made in spots
Gettin' G's flippin' keys keep a semiautomatic 
Get the money nobody move no need for panic
Never judge a book by the cover
Cause I''m the other brother word to mother 
I'm sought by the hunter
Raised in the projects cashing checks using techs 
Get respect with a razor to the neck
Money increase when bodies decease
Release by police rollin' deep and play for keeps
Pistol and guns bring funds for the wicked ones
Not being a bum chum living by dum dum
Mind never shallow, pride never swallow
Live by the hollow, lead never follow
Peace to my niggas on the east with a full clip
Love for my niggas on the west bloods crips

Hook

Verse 3:
Gold in the ghetto is the capsals 
Seems they sell the crack to majority black and hispanic
Tinted is the youth that I rap to my beat that they snap to
Officials are left in a panic
Infared can find me hiding under a tree a car or even in a ditch
But you can't stop pounds of cocain from entering the country
Now ain't this a bitch
Just say no is easy when your living in the White House
But here on my street to just to say yes means simply
Of the good life you wanna take a little piece
Now the war on drugs ain't drug war
Don't break laws for a very different cause
One side sell and the other side buy
Both sides lie and induce genocide
Products move with the military force
Many many many many many lives are lost that's a little cost
Millions to be made in the drug trade people gettin' paid
Powder the people really crave
Uncle Sam says take another hit 
Transport the product with his planes and his ships
Cause theres no coke fields in the neighborhood
No coke fields in the hood
Down here cocaine sells so good 
If we could grow it you know that we would
Then I get a pistol fistful of crystal
Provide to the public just like Al Capone
Not a criminal just running business
Dealer of death and many die by one little stone

[Hook: Cl'Che - 2x]
Now if you want it
You gotta work it
Now if you want it
You gotta work it

[D-Reck]
Slow down mama, let me tell you one thang
If you wanna know me, you gotta know the game
There's a whole lot come, with this fortune and fame
Some dogs just can't, be careful with change
Got too many women, so they say I'm no good
Making too much paper, so I'm misunderstood
But I spit it like I get it, and I'm good with the wood
When I hit it I ain't quit it, till I know she into it
She shakes she shivers, she fill like a river
She upset she stress, trying to catch me slipping
She fiending she scheming, trying to get this thug
But she knew what it was, when she met this thug

[Hook: Cl'Che - 2x]

[Hook: Z-Ro]
Now if I hit it, I ain't gon quit it
Girl I'ma get it, hot as a skillet
Now when I drill it, I'ma make you spill it
Girl you gon feel it, that's on the real yeah

[Cl'Che]
Boy you gotta drop it, if you trying to hit it
You gotta work your mouth, down in the Dirty 3rd we call the South
You want a classy chick, you want a nasty chick
You gotta gotta know, what you working with
Cause I'm a choosey chick, I'm a Gucci chick
And I taking no small, mmmm

[Z-Ro]
I'ma work it anyway, you ain't got to beg
Legs behind your head, on the edge of your bed
Steady pumping and I'm bumping, and I'm leaving it red
Whooping the life out the butt, now and leaving it dead
Telling me what I got to do, to get ass
Only thing I got to do, is get cash
Might get some hydro, or get some hash
I don't need no viagra, to help me last
You bout to get done, when you get on top
Give it about three seconds, you'll be on bottom
If we ever get into it, you'll take it to heart
And wanna take me to war, and you'll be on cock

[Hook: Cl'Che]

[Hook: Z-Ro]
Now if I hit it, I ain't gon quit it
Girl I'ma get it, hot as a skillet

[Noke D]
Now I don't want you, to get the wrong idea
I ain't trying to make no, love in here
Mr. Thugger man, baby have no fear
I'm hitting and I'm getting, up out of here
Now I don't really mean, no disrespect
But you gotta bend, your back and neck
It's so good, I wanna show D-Reck
Just for a sec, let him feel the wet
And before we go, you gotta let Z-Ro
Bend you over, touch your toes
'Case you didn't know, we call em run through
Just what you, just let us do

[Hook: Cl'Che - 2x]

[Hook: Z-Ro]
Now if I hit it, I ain't gon quit it
Girl I'ma get it, hot as a skillet
Now when I drill it, I'ma make you spill it
Girl you gon feel it, that's on the real yeah

Chromed out (*edited*) out tokens'll right this
That frozen alley had my lip on some mad (*edited*)
Cuz we stack chips, had us grove to a plat' list

Get the Nafis dip, bouncers at the door clear the path
It's Nafis forever clique

[Boys II Men]
Have them take a place
People sittin' 'round
Riders on the side 
No one's even tried to get down
Brotha's being fly
Ladies acting shy
Ain't no doubt to loose
I'm gon' get my groove on tonight
Gotta dance, gotta dance, gotta dance

1 - 	Ain't no use in holding up the wall
	Come and get that body on the floor
	Baby, lose control and scream and shout
	Get your boogie down and work it out

Everybody's out, party's going on
And we're gonna rock until the sunlight crash and dawn
('Till the break of dawn)
Ain't a thing that you can do
When the rhythm's calling you 
Let it work it's way right into you
Gotta dance, gotta dance, gotta dance

Repeat 1
Repeat 1

Na na na na na
Na na na na na
Na na na na na
Na na na na na

[Garrison Hearst]
Make it move there's no need to hold back now
Hit the floor, let loose and watch me break this down
Keep it mellow or we can get wild 
See you haters in the corner tryin' to peep my style
You want my stash, gold, checks, sports illustrated 
I'm motivated by the fact that I'm being hated
Now my pockets swell, game straight outta ATL
G-land, Boyz II Men, work it out
What's the deal

On duckin' from them flashin' lights
'Member when we could chill
The side of the street
With no police
Fuckin' with the homeys
Stay true to the game, that's how I got my name
See, Dame'll never change
It's 805 worldwide
Just check my MySpace
I'm out, chasin' my cake
There's nothin' like this, holmes
Gettin' down at home
Chasing all these bitches, they be blowin' up my phone
I been many places, but I'm S.P. zone
It's that 805 Kingz
We do the damn thang
Loco man, it's on, Cali's back up on the throne
With the youngsters in the game, show them there's a proper way
It's more than big rims and them iced-out chains

But together, we represent it like nobody else

Loco, baby, in the 80's, I was a baby

Rockin' the latest Prima gear and Adidas
You should've seen us, took me two weeks to speak English
Straight from Mexico, rifa
Ciudad Juarez
Grosspark Elementary to Oxnard College
Knowledge
Was a pain
By the books and the ballers
Honest, mama done raised no fool
I blaze, fool
Cruisin' down Savoirs, rode, and played ya mode
Before the cars have thugs
(???) clubs
Seen the streets flooded with handguns and hard drugs
Remember ABC Switch, la gente
Throwin' barbecues in Ventura, a rollo verde
But now the city blew up, grew up with mad peeps
Got professional rappers
And professional athleets

I come from a jungle, with a trunk load of punk hoes (nigga)
Muzzle this animal, fuck with mechanical
Gun totin hazardous cutthroat, canteloupe can split it
And the Pope couldn't prevent me from shittin on niggaz
Fitted caps get blew back like bad wind, imagine backspinnin
into a casket, it happens when bastards try to act masculine (hoe)
A hell raiser, I smack the skin off your man's face
so fast it'll leave acne on my hand when it land (hah!)
Placed in a class where professors came to school with Smith 'n Wessons
just to teach us a lesson, had that ass hangin up with the flag (yeah)
Parental discretion, I'll send you a video
with me naked havin a session on my urinal (RESPECT IT! HAH!)
When you kill in the nighttime and claimin yo' innocence
I'll be waitin ready to A.K. you and yo' egg Bene-dick {AHH!}
Usin yo' balls to play tennis with (hah)
You'll be in some shit like flies and fuck the witnesses

[Chorus 2X: Swifty McVay]

(WHAT!) Whatever you want, we providin it diligently
(PUMP!) Double barrel wherever we go willingly
(DUMPIN!) On opposition in the streets or industry

[Kon Artis a.k.a. Mr. Porter]
You was born I was hatched, but you came out deformed
I have nuts of a horse, and you ain't got no balls
Come runnin with tec-9's whenever niggaz would call
Bang-bang-bang, bang-bang, shoot up classway halls
I don't give a FUCK, who you call to come
You came with thirty niggaz, I only came with one
That just goes to show you how much scrap a nigga got in me
You gone off Henny, that liquid courage drivin you into these
situations you in, don't get that "Purple Pills" shit confused
with us bein cool up here singin "My Band"
I'm sure you see these little kids cryin over me man
They'll do anything for a fuckin autograph
So say that shit loud enough out of the fuckin crowd and
I'll show you the meanin of die-hard fans
Saddam Hussein who sews, who radical act
A mechanical bomb attached to my pelvis
That's what I mean by get, back; I mean get, back
Or find your head detached from that Mitchell & Ness
So find your spinal cord, uh-uh-oh I digress
I guess I'm just too fresh, to finish that line
Denaun's ain't next

I came to bring some Christmas Spirit
I got a big bag now guess what's in it
Something for the rich and something for the po
So Merry Christmas and ho ho ho

L.A. Sunshine:
Ho Ho Ho Merry Christmas my foot
I'ma tell you what Santa really put
under my so-called tree but in reality 
looked like nothin but a decorated pole to me

Special K:
Man, you talk about a tree it makes wonder
cause I never had a tree to put anything under
if I ever did luck up and get a tree
there was never anything under it for me

Kool Moe Dee:
Man I don't what y'all talking about
cause when I come to your town I just get kicked out
You think I'm getting presents made for free
I gotta pay them elves and ain't nobody paying me

L.A. Sunshine:
You big fat whale you might as well quit
cause I can name a hundred presents that I didn't get
and if I did get a present it would be a hand-me-down
Yo I got this for Christmas now how that sound

Special K:
It sounds good to me cause I'm about to freeze
you wanna see something look at the bottom of these
me and brothers can't go out at the same time
cause a coat that's theirs is a coat that's mine

Kool Moe Dee:
Man I know one thing y'all better get off my neck
and wait till you get ya welfare check
go on down to the office and stand in the line
better hurry up see I got mine

Chorus:
Jingle, Jangle, Jingle for the po
and once you get your welfare check
Yo kiss my mistletoe
Ho Ho Ho
Ho Ho Ho

L.A. Sunshine:
That's why the presents keep getting mixed up
cause year after year you keep fucking up
and now I know why cause you always drunk
instead of G.I. Joe you send me this junk

Special K:
That ain't a G.I. Joe that's a G.I. jerk
with a kungfu grip that don't even work
so all I did was just put him away 
cause my G.I. Joe looked G.I. gay

Kool Moe Dee:
That's why you don't get presents now
cause you're just ingrates
if the G.I. Joe is gay what difference does it make
after all he's just a doll ain't too much he can do
if you ask me boy I ain't to sure about

L.A. Sunshine:
Listen bloato in your big fat suit
next time say no don't send no substitute
cause I asked you for a beatbox and you know what I got?
Dougie Fresh, you know that kid from down the block

Dougie Fresh:(beatboxing)

Special K:
For a fascimile we must admit
Dougie Fresh was good and made a perfect fit
He's the only reason why we weren't totally mad
Without Dougie our Christmas would've been really sad

"About, about this about that."
I bet I put somethin in yo mind
To make you heel it up bring it back come rewind
Now I'm, just a rap artist
Not sayin that I'm the best not the smartest but
But I come up wit things ya never seen
Things you never heard of like money and the murder like
Next thing you know we in the rest
Drinkin liqour, puffin on the buddha sess
I threw on me a Rough Rider
I slid inside her

Chorus:

Wit my cheebas, my liquors
My condoms, hit the ass
I had the cheebas, them liquors
The condoms, hit the ass
We had the cheebas, the liquors
The condoms, hit the ass
We had the cheeba, the liquor
The condom, the ass!!

Verse Two: Freaky Tah

Don't be fuckin wit my shorty, sippin on her forty
Or puffin on her blunt, cuz she's no fuckin stunt
True to the game, goes to school for her edu-ma-cation
While I bounce around the nation
From nation and back to New York
I twist the cap, pop the cork 
and take a long walk to the court
Buddha, I spark chill wit my crew
Who it be Mr. Cheeks when I sip my nigga brew
And get in, you gets the fan understand
Bouncin, we gets to buzzin forty ouncin
Hit Virginia, I get the shorty-shorty
Hippin on the forty on the corner wanna bone
In home or out on my own
I get whatever hit her, and then get rid of her
After I'm done with it, my man, he wanna get with it
Then he hit it from da back, now my crew wanna hit it
But me Freaky Tah, trip off and I creep
Niggaz they be buggin, but don't ever peep my style
My crew is buckwild
We been in this game for awhile

Chorus:

Smokin cheebas, the liquors
The condoms, the ass

It's the cheebas, them liquors
The condoms, the ass (repeat 3X)

Verse Three: Mr. Cheeks

Now before you run up in that
wear your mutha poke-pro-fa-lac
stick, before you run up in skinz
Before you bone, run your mouth to yo mens
Make sure that you protect yourself
That shows that you respect yourself
Now don't violate your skin and your balls
You'll be making, the phone call
See Dr. Abraham or them condoms now
You know that you best to be aware
Don't go bustin up and nuttin in
Let a nigga from the Lost Boyz tell ya somethin
No man know he play he the fuckin game
But AIDS ain't got no fuckin name
All you chancy niggaz that's playin cute
Don't jump, without a parachute

Verse Four: Pete Rock

Yeah here we go as I shoot from the top of the key
The Lost Boyz in the house with the Capital P
Grab a chair relax and pass the Alize
I'ma tell you a little somethin about this chick around my way
She was a dime with a brown skin complexion
She looked so good you'd think you wouldn't need protection
Girlfriend was top choice selection...
...around in every section
They got twisted, she said no condom so he risked it
Caught in the mix and now you sick kid
Word is bond, I thought by now you learned your lesson
Fucking around with no protection
So emphasize this, stressin the point, and analyze this
Don't get caught, with the virus
It's the Chocolate Boy Wonder with the LB Fam
Listen up, use your condom when your third leg stand

[Chorus fades]

[50 Cent]
Now homie I say I run it (run it) cause I'm in control

Party poppin shawty says she comin with me tonight

Either I'm bobbin ma head or I'm just stadin their watchin

And I protect what I got, I'm in the house with my blade
Nigga you front you gone get it, ok now maybe I said it

[Eminem]
When me and Fif got together to do this music
The more we became enveloped we just developed a fellowship through it
It's no pretend shit, it's friendship, me nemesis is your nemesis
Ain't for him, it's just media, see to them it's just images
But this shit is no gimmicks, this is blood in and blood out
When there's beef you jus' gotta know when to butt in and butt out
If there's a problem we solve it, if we don't resolve it
It usually just evolves into one big brawl and we all get involved in it
We should all get a merit, this much beef we inherit
And wear it like a badge with honor, pass it around and share it
And let it go to whoever's holdin the most current people on their shoulders
And their soldiers got their backs til it's over
But tonight, we ain't comin here to beef with nobody
We came to party, Banks, Cashis and Mr. Ferrari
So is Shady Aftermizzath back in that ass? You izzask
Come izzon, what kind of fizzucked up quizzestion is 'at?

[Chorus: 50 Cent, Eminem]
Who run it?
You know, you actin like you don't know
I tear the club up fo sho
This flow is gon bring more dough
And you know but you actin like you don't know
Who run it?
I say you know, you actin like you don't know
I tear the club up fo sho
This flow is gon bring more dough
And you know but you actin like you don't know

[Cashis]
Pistol play ricochet, see where the victim lay
Slumped over bleeding J.F.K
H.K. to your chest plate cave
I'll ride to the death, do you rep that way?
Forever ima be a Shady 7-4 gangsta
Plus I survive everything you got in that chamber
I thrive off of danger, jumpin in all beef
You keep talking shit now the squad called me

[Lloyd Banks]
Enough holdin back the steam, Em let off a magazine
Dappadon Cappa queen mixed in with Cashis creams
Started off with half a dream, developed into what you see
Telling ain't my cup of tea, can't tell I'm a fuckin G
I'm on automatic when I'm at it, start static
And you splattered, shit shattered, I'm a walkin bitch magnet
Spit it how I love it, live it all the way to the limit
And I'm always on my pivot for my digits, you dig it?

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Who run it?
You know, you actin like you don't know
I tear the club up fo sho
This flow is gon bring more dough
And you know but you actin like you don't know
Who run it?
You know, you actin like you don't know
I tear the club up fo sho
This flow is gon bring more dough
And you know but you actin like you don't know
Who run it?

Song:   You Hear About It
Typed by: davpaul@dove.net.au

[Intro - Abstract Rude]
Ugh, ugh, Living Legends
Ugh ugh, Ab Rude
Mass Men, another West Coast connect
From L.A. to the Bay bwoy
We ain't just bout it, y'all hear about it
Ugh ugh, when you hear about it, when you hear about it

	And so it was said
	People remember the Legends
	And as it was read
	Masses of men get the message
	(And you hear about it)
	When you livin in the cities of the Bay
	(And you hear about it)
	When you livin in the city of L.A.
	(And you hear about it)
	When you livin in the cities of the Bay
	(And you hear about it)
	When you livin in the city of L.A.

And so it was said, and created affirmative
Born rappin, German, they fertilised amino acids
Matter with mass, intricate plot
That or just ask infinite questions in a scientific melting pot
As it was read, when activated a new permanent
geographic, made it possible to inhabit
Thieves of air, water of blood, livin off the land
Grown from the mud, thoughts of a man
are the building blocks of pyramid Egyptian
Stone wall inscriptions that told all of myths and mythology
Depictions and prophecy, crucifixion and casualty
Communication by telepathy
Exceptionally gifted, man lifted his mental existence
Went to the distance, geometric inches
of math, he clinches his nostalgic pass
Underground fossils found in solid rock
Evolution of the mind, look at precision of the tool of the trade
Decisions of a fool never made
The revolution of rhyme is like when man started talkin
Somethin new to hear, ears hawkin by choice
The voice of hip hop, Mother Earth, generation X
I know what I'm sayin so some next, but you gon' hear about it

	And so it was said
	People remember the Legends
	And as it was read
	Masses of men get the message
	(And you hear about it)
	When you livin in the city of the Bay
	(And you hear about it)
	When you livin in the city of L.A.
	
	People remember the Legends
	And as it was read
	Masses of men get the message
	(And you hear about it)
	When you livin in the cities of the Bay
	(And you hear about it)
	When you livin in the city of L.A.

[Living Legends]
Now could I join, both sides of a coin forming one whole?
Warning one's soul that this power is too swole
to be reckoned with, effective, give the respect where it's due
I live like I know so expect that I do the true
test of my talents, living by my word, speech balance
while my actions have em latching on like velcro
Conceited? Hell no, I be, seated in the front row
of your lecture, I betcha, if you have somethin to learn me
Earn the attention, test my retention, and best my intention
is to be great, recognise or be late
to the function, gathered in conjunction with my folks
Up and down the coast, we toast, to tightness
Ignite this flame, recite this game back, apply it if I came wack
Deny it or riot, quiet, on full volume
You're all tuned in, when the time's right
Grab the rippy now but you can't hear me, there's no limelight
I gather up my style, bounce flip it, bubble off and rip it
Come equipped and ship it out for you to hear about

Have you heard about the time the man slept, and crept up in cotton?
Visualisin such a mysterious movie of a life
I lived it twice before I entered
Remembered as a superhuman, inventions I invented
The thought of not, I'm bendin the rules I's meanted
Content with the life without politician's decisions
makin my dimension an unstable form
A habituation, watchin us, you know just waitin
for a chance to get inside, the centre of divine
Principles, it's his to pull yourself, OUT
when you're sunk below your chin, the light - it never ends
no matter where it has begun
A millennium of sights to see before the rays of the sun
I'm knowin how long it shall be glowin
Shall I continue showin y'all
the lighter side from the shadows where they seem to hide
Revitalisin with a rhyme that abides by the soul
that resides behind the focus of my eyes glow
A legendary myth that carries the gift of surprise though

[Ab Rude] And you hear about it, and you hear about it

	And so it was said
	People remember the Legends
	And as it was read
	Masses of men get the message
	(And you hear about it)
	When you livin in the city of the Bay
	(And you hear about it)
	When you livin in the city of L.A.

	And so it was said
	People remember the Legends
	And as it was read
	Masses of men get the message
	(And you hear about it)
	When you livin in the city of the Bay
	(And you hear about it)
	When you livin in the city of L.A.

[Living Legends]
It's the crystal method, see through evidences at hand
Standin across two properties, eye of the perfect detective
Vision's reflective at attention, my invention
Something from a time you have endured, subdued, by ghost in tune
To most they only feel the full moon, they parked outside
In the world we live in, give in to the signal, they sinkin
Depths are driven to drive into a pole, enter your soul
The soul has risen, partake on a mission
Moon Apocalypse, Now they see the picture, ??? pass the mixture
To fix the future, elixir with a suture
Mutations fade to inner ???, the name is Melancholy
Walk with a frown when the fall leaves falling
My answering machine when they're calling, sounds across the washroom
Clean your face for the dirty looks you pass are scrappy
Bury the negativity, for it's affecting me gravity
Physically, Cali, heavenly, let me be

	[Abstract Rude]
	People remember the Legends
	And as it was read
	Masses of men get the message
	(And you hear about it)
	When you livin in the city of the Bay
	(And you hear about it)
	When you livin in the city of L.A.

	And so it was said
	People remember the Legends
	And as it was read
	Masses of men get the message
	(And you hear about it)
	When you livin in the city of the Bay
	(And you hear about it)
	When you livin in the city of L.A.

[Outro - Abstract Rude]
And you hear about it
In the cities of the Bay
(And you hear about it)
When you livin in the city of L.A.
Living Legends in the city of the Bay
Mass Men in the city of L.A.
People remember the Legends
People remember the Legends
Masses of men get the message
Masses of men get the message
You livin in the city of the Bay
When you livin in the city of L.A.
(Frisco) Living Legends in the city of the Bay
(South Central) Mass Men in the city of L.A.

[Intro: Beretta 9]
Yeah, one two, check it

[Beretta 9]
Aiyo, what makes Kinetic get on some live wire shit?
Not much, but when Beretta, I'm on some set a fire shit
I'm no devil, but the flow is hell, though
Just on another level, I'm quick to tell you 'hell no'
And never trouble, I haven't been to jail, so
In case you see me there, don't think, I won't rebel, or
It's not, I don't care, just you're not playin' fair, bro'
That's where I stand, but you better get out my chair, hoe
Don't understand, but I bet you, hear the snare go
When I pop you in the ear, and your head bounce on the dance floor
Why you even think, you even had the chance for
B.O.B.B.Y., B9, and Diaz for?

[Chorus: RZA]
*Schh* You get shot in the ass for, talkin' that bullshit, and as for
You wild niggas tryin' to rap, like you bustin' them gats, ya'll dreaming
They be talkin' that they bustin' your cap
And they carryin' straps, but they dreamin'
Niggas be, dreamin', ya'll niggas just dreaming

[RZA]
Yo, chalked from the wood grain and alcohol, son, I chew barks
Spin your head like Technics, made you write the new mart
See The W footprint? Made from the shoe mark
Yeah, it's Bob Digital, bitch, not Bob Newhart
Splash through the Norwegian sea like Black Orca
Sippin' on weed, next beer with Johnny Walker
No scrutiny, no shipwreck, or mutiny
Got the kevlar suit, don't think about shooting me
Holding the golden scepter, you be folding
Bow to The RZA like the great King Oden
My wiz is mighty like is Isis, my son is like Osirus
Wu-Tang Clan be the wisest
Like Professor Xavier, got stock like Doctor Octavious
More Vikings than Scandinavia, you better watch your behavior
I be myself, so I'mma be the self savior

Sometimes you feel insecure
Trust me girl I understand
But even with no manicure
Baby girl I'll hold your hand
You look so good when you walking by
Sexy comes in every size keep wearing that
You ain't playing
You got yourself a new man no need no workout plan
I call that baby fat
But it sure look good to me, see...

[Chorus]
You're so beautiful
You got me watching you
Like a camera do
I still wait for you
You got me
You're so beautiful
You got me watching you
Like a camera do
I still wait for you
You got me

You wear your glasses you can't see
Girl I love your crooked smile
Hair ain't done, you're makeup free
You'll never go out of style
Cause you ain't got time to pack
You look too good to be mad
Got way too much class all up inside them jeans
You should be happy with a nappy
Hot damn have you seen them thighs
You been all up inside
The cornbread and collard greens
You call me papi and I like it wild

[Chorus]

This the kind of song make a woman love a man
A woman love a man
A woman love a man now
This the kind of song make a woman love a man
A woman love a man
Adam and Eve and Clan
This the kind of song make a woman love a man
A woman love a man
A woman love a man this this
This the kind of song make a woman love a man

Where she from?
Uh-hmmm
She is amazing
Mm-mmmm
Whoa-oh
I've never seen her around here before (Whoa-oh)
I'm gonna go get her name
Mm-mmmm
Yeah
So fresh baby

(Verse 1)
So fresh, she's so fresh
Brand new
Never had to met a female who looked like you
Kinda weird
But when I looked at your face
Don't laugh, but I couldn't figure our your race
Somethin' different
Nasty
Tasty, sexy
The sound of your voice even seemed to impress me, whoa
You please my eyes, you make me rise
You got them perfect thighs
Girl, what's your name?
Girl, where you from?
Girl, can I get me some?
Look at your eyes, even got bomb hair (Oooh)
I ain't a pervert, but I gotta stare
She's strange
Somethin' I ain't never had (Never)
But I wouldn't mind
Hookin' up with that
We can have a few drinks
Open things up
I hope you don't mind if I tear you up

Chorus: Dominator
Your love is bomb
Your love is fresh
Your style is cool
I'm feeling you
you feeling me, too
Your body's bangin' (Uh!)
I'm anticipatin'
To get with you
I'll make you move
Sugar, what you wanna do?

Bridge: Dominator
Girl, if you let me take you home
Take me home, take me home
I promise I will call tomorrow
Call, to-mo-rrow
And if, by chance, you let me bone
Let me bone, let me bone
We gonna leave the lights on
Oh, yeah
Dominator, Dominator, that's my name
Ain't too many hoochies hip to my game
When you see my eyes and you hear my jive
Baby, can each other difference from the truth you like

Repeat Chorus

Hook: Dominator
Check it out, girl
You make me feel like (Oh!)
I wanna make you scream like (Oh!)
Yeah
So fly, so fresh
I must confess, your love's the best
You make me feel like (Oh!)
I wanna make you scream like (Oh!)
Yeah
So tight and cute
I can't explain, this lust for you

(Verse 2)
She got a big ol' bag, she got a ghetto rap
She got class, stop, she gotta be like that
Look at that bounce on the dancefloor, ouch
More bounce to the ounce, and you know all of that counts
Come with me
I'm a set you free
I'm weird like you
Weird as can be
There is such a place
That creates
Such, a melody
And if you let me find it
I'm a get right back behind it
See, I'm old school, baby
And you got that flavor
Nobody even comes close, I'm a take her
Go on, and get to get my grub on a plate
And find a big park, and stay, so we can go out, to I don't know
When, real late, pick the girl up at eight
Think I find me a mate, Nu Shooz, I Can't Wait

{Maybach Music}

[Rick Ross]
As you listen to my music
I want you to see my point of view
Comin from a single parent home
Wanted everything but startin with very little
Y'know?

[Stalley]
Boy~! I'm shinnin on these hoes
Triple gold Daytons when I'm ridin on these hoes
Got that leather and wood you know, how that story goes
I'm always on my toes when I ain't pushin a wheel
Tires screech and squeal as I bend it to the top
All these haters sit and watch my climb, wishin that it stop
I got a crown on my wrist, and a crown on my top
And I got it all alone now they crowdin my spot, man
Is this the game that I chose?
Nobody gave me ish so it's nobody I owe
I got that Leeroy glow, soul of an assassin
And I'm tryin to have me backed in, off up in that corner
But I'm off up in this bitch! Gold danglin all over
This W tat' sweater and it's double M G
I ain't gonna be slept on forever, tell the Sandman to wake 'em up
and help me count this cheddar, not enough hands on me
Eyes on the sparrow and I'm laid up like a pharaoh
Got a couple grand on me I'm just livin my life
They said I would change, I'm just provin them right
I was broke before, so I'll be broke some more
Man that don't sound right
but what it sound like is a good year for me
I used to look at the future and I couldn't bear to see
Me my momma,and my sister was the bears in the tree
Porridge in my bowl, tryin to keep hold of my souls
Now I'm the big man to beat
It's funny how it unfolds when you start shakin that tree
Heh, when you start shakin that tree
It's funny how it unfolds when you start shakin that tree
Look at me

[Chorus]
My back is to the wind, and I just want to win
But nobody ever gave me nothin, nothin; nothin, nothin
Lookin at the sky, pray that I survive
Self-made but I gave you nothin, nothin; nothin, nothin

[Wale]
Wale though, look, yo, uhh
Gold Roley, most hoes don't know me
Blowin O.G., I never socialize with police
Glock 40, never had it why I'ma need it?
It'll be them niggaz that's lookin for it momma'll be grievin
I ain't thuggin - who the fuck is you mean-muggin?
I seen the meanest and toughest niggaz Speedy Gonzales
Don't obsess over money, I'm just eager for comfort
Don't obsess over fame, I just speak to the public
Ain't reached my zenith but all them people see that I'm buzzin
Shoutouts +Seattle+ but these rappers they stealin my +Thunder+
Lost a lot of homies, none of 'em even died
I see 'em all the time but jealousy is sabotage
Ridin in another drop, ain't talkin Enterprise
They try to see me get diabetes from humble pie
Yeah, I hate to lose more than they love to win
That's the difference 'tween me and them - Wale

[Chorus]

[Rick Ross]
I wake up in the mornin, roll up my marijuana (ugh)
Thinkin 'bout tomorrow, I don't want to be a martyr
Stress that I be under blame that on my baby momma
Pills that I be poppin wonder will they take me under?
Ruty Mac 11 for these hoe niggaz with drama
Success in my possession had you murdered out of karma
All these niggaz snitchin witness perjury your honor
Handle my business, tuition for my kids' college
Dope boy stylin, DEA target
One point seven for these VS's on my collar
Born in the projects now I'm known as the hottest
Lay your whole label down, bitch I came for the dollars

[Chorus]
